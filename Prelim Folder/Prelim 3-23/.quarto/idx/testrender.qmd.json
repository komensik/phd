Many millions more experience incarceration indirectly – through proximal contact – as family, friends, or neighbors of those incarcerated – or through victimization, having been harmed by a crime prosecuted by the state.

These perceptions of deservingness are not purely personal – they are shaped by myriad factors including policy designs themselves [@schneider2019].
