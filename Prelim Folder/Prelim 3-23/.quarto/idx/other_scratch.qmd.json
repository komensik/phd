I also shed new light on two unexamined components of policy feedback of the carceral state: whether contact shapes views on criminal legal policy, and feedback effects of victimization.\n\nMy theoretical starting point is that perceptions of what groups like carceral citizens deserve are often based on discursive social constructions about them (Schneider and Ingram, 1993). Policy directly shapes these constructions, as it produces both resource and interpretive feedback effects that are part of the discourse that shapes constructions. In forming opinions about policy and deciding what inequalities are tolerable, publics draw on salient social constructions about the relevant policy target and use them in a heuristic process to quickly determine whether a target is “deserving” of help (citation). Theoretically, then these judgements translate to, or at play in the formation of, beliefs about criminal legal policy.\n\nHere, I suggest that this loop between policy design and the messages it transmits about what it’s targets deserve may be interrupted for some citizens due to their connections to those who are justice involved, Emerging evidence that *responses to* the criminal legal system’s policy messages vary, and specifically that some respond to the negative messages transmitted by criminal legal policy with dubiousness towards state legitimacy suggest perceptions of what its targets deserve may vary as well (Walker 2020, Harris 2025).\n\n--\n\n--\n\nPervasive, racialized (Ghandnooshh 2014) and dehumanized sterotypes about carceral citizens () tend to motivate harsh assessments of in such contexts as juries (Levinson 2007, Levinson et al 2010), sentencing decisions (Rehavi and Starr 2014) and assessments of culpability (Donovan 2007, Israel-Trummel and Streeter 2021), suggesting that more information may translate to more measured perceptions of carceral citizens. But this might of course go the other way.\n\nGiven evidence that information about carceral citizens like conviction status can decrease support for policy help, this may not always be the case (Uggen and Manza 2006).\n\nIn seeking to understand how the criminal legal system shapes and reshapes politics, policy feedback literature has under-examined how victimization factors into behavioral and attitudinal outcomes of the incarcerated and their networks, as well as feedback effects that result from coming in contact with the system as a victim of crime.\n\nIt is useful to begin by considering broad patterns of deservingness scores.

By year-end 2001, more than 5.6 million U.S. adults had served time in a state or federal prison (BOP 2003), and by 2010, an estimated 8 % of adults in the US had a felony conviction and 3 % had served or were serving prison time (Shannon et al 2017). While systematized data on non-felony convictions remain, as Stenson and Mayson (2018) put it, \"absurdly, embarassingly\" (p. 732) elusive, they estimate 13.2 million such cases are filed annually. Many millions more experience incarceration indirectly – through proximal contact – as family, friends, or neighbors of those incarcerated – or through victimization, having been harmed by a crime prosecuted by the state.\n\nThis widespread direct and proximal carceral contact with the carceral state has generated a growing body of scholarship that attempts to understand how contact with this particular state policy feeds back to shape attitudes towards the state (Lerman and Weaver 2014), political identities (Owens 2014), and political engagement (White 2019). Implicit in much of this literature is the contention that feedbacks matter not only because they reshape political participation, but because they may influence what citizens come to demand from the state — and thus subsequent policy outcomes (Skocpol 1992, Mettler and SoRelle 2023). Yet, while this theoretical possibility is widely acknowledged, most empirical studies have probed strictly electoral consequences (Manza and Uggen 2006, Burch 2011), leaving open questions of how contact with the carceral state shapes individuals' views *on criminal legal policy itself* (White 2022). Moreover, while the overlap between those targeted by the criminal legal system and victims, in behalf of whose interest it purportedly acts, is well-established (Godsoe 2022), little is known about feedback effects of victimization.\n\nAt the same time, scholars across policy domains have shown that public support for state intervention is shaped by beliefs about whether a given target group is *deserving* (Ellis and Faricy 2019, DeSante 2013). Further still, such 'deservingness perceptions' often predict state policy outcomes (Kreitzer, Maltby and Smith 2022). These perceptions are not purely personal – they shape and are shaped by policy design (Schneider and Ingram 2019). Yet, their direct role in shaping opinions of *criminal legal policy* – and how they are shaped *by* contact with criminal legal policy – remains undertheorized and empirically underexamined.\n\nThis paper brings these frameworks together to address these three gaps. I explore how direct and proximal experiences with the carceral state shape perceptions of what incarcerated people deserve – and how or whether their effects on perceptions of deservingness, broadly conceived, translate to opinions on policy. Building on both liness of scholarship, I theorize that carceral contact may disrupt dominant discursive cues about who incarcerated people are and what they deserve. Further still, I draw suggest that contact may change *how* individuals *respond* to such cues – or constructions of carceral citizens – loosening the relationship between deservingness and policy preferences altogether, especially when contact fosters distrust in the legitimacy of the state itself (Walker 2020, Harris 2025).\n\nI test these propositions using original 2024 survey data capturing Americans' experiences with the carceral system, their perceptions of a range of policy targets, and their attitudes towards prison-related policy reforms. The data allow for a unique empirical examination of how deservingness judgementss may vary across direct and indirect experiences with incarceration and victimization – and how these judgements structure policy preferences.\n\nIn doing so, this paper makes three contributions. First, it extends theories of social constructions and deservingness – the latter of which was largely developed in the context of welfare and redistributive policy - into the domain of criminal legal policy. Second, it sheds new light on how policy or institutional experience and proximity modifies deservingness perceptions and their correspondence to *substantive policy views* – allowing for a contribution to our understanding of policy feedback of the carceral state. Last, it responds to recent interventions that experiences of victimization constitute a critical but understudied component of this feedback loop (Levine and Russell 2023) and deepens our understanding of how it – in relation to direct and proximal contact, and as a kind of proximal contact of it's own – can alter the public's orientation toward punishment, policy, and state legitimacy. More broadly, these findings are useful to audiences outside of the strictly academic domain. Policymakers and advocates for criminal legal policy reform increasingly target the exclusion of those \"closest to the pain,\" or with first-hand experience with the carceral state, from from agenda-setting, policy making, and policy implementation (see [Pressley 2023](https://pressley.house.gov/2023/12/06/pressley-welch-unveil-historic-bill-to-guarantee-right-to-vote-for-incarcerated-citizens/)). Understanding how impacted groups differ in their approach to policy – and whether the preferences of most victims and perpetrators are as far apart as dominant narratives would suggest – may be particularly useful in this domain.\n\nThe remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. In section 2, I elaborate first on key findings from social constructions, deservingness, and policy feedback literature, with particular attention to how they inform expectations about criminal legal policy. Section 3 develops theoretical framework, outlining how carceral contact may shape perceptions of deservingness and how those perceptions may, in turn, influence policy views. Section 4 then presents the data and analytic strategy, drawing on a newly fielded national survey to test these relationships. I conclude in section 5 with a brief discussion of implications for theories of deservingness, policy feedback, the politics of punishment.\n\n. . .\n\n## Literature\n\nHow does contact with the criminal legal system affect perceptions of its targets? And what do these deservingness perceptions mean for policy views? These questions intersect with two literatures. First, scholarship on social constructions and deservingness examines how groups become characterized as deserving or undeserving of government assistance, and shows that both policy views and outcomes hinge on such characterizations (Schneider and Ingram 1993, Smith and Kreitzer 2024, Oorschot 2006). While this literature leaves open the question of how experiences with policy might alter characterizations about it's targets, lessons from policy feedback literature suggest they might. Across domains, including the carceral state, policy feedback literature shows that policies can shape attitudes towards the state and institutions, one's sense of \"civic self,\" and political behavior through \"resource\" and \"interpretive\" effects (see Mettler and SoRelle 2023, White 2022). In the criminal legal domain, scholars find that these effects culminate in diminished trust in the state, but increasingly debate when and why targets respond not with political withdrawal, but with apparant reappraisal – of both the state and the messages it sends about it's targets (Walker 2020, Anoll et al 2019). As we will see, much of this work maintains an interest in but does test how how direct or proximal criminal legal contact shapes attitudes not towards the state, but rather what it's targets deserve from it. I briefly review these literatures below.\n\n#### SCOTP\n\nIn the wake of Schneider and Ingram's (1993) theory of social constructions, scholars have coalesced around the idea that attitudes towards policy targets are in dialectic with policy. That is, policy design not only has \"interpretive effects\" on its targets but also shapes discourse *about* them. In this way, policy can \"telegraph to the public how target groups should be treated,\" and helps to produce social constructions or \"value-laden components, including stereotypes, dominant ideologies, and assumptions\" about groups (Smith and Kreitzer 2024, PAGE). As consequence, social constructions are contingent. They are contingent, for example, on local, state, and political and cultural contexts and also on the political identity of and ideology held by the 'perceiver' (Smith and Kreitzer 2018, 768). This means both that policy can *reflect* existing social constructions, and that it can feed back to causally affect further social constructions of who targets are. The notion of who targets *are* in turn affects how people perceive what they *should* receive – i.e., what they deserve. These perceptions matter because they are theorized to be understood as policy preferences and translated by policymakers into policy that helps or hinders groups, reinforcing their social constructions (Schneider and ingram 2019).\n\n#### CARIN\n\nA related stream of literature explains that people form quick judgements about policy targets' deservingness by evaluating constructions along five dimensions in an evolutionarily-grounded impulse to help \"reciprocators\" and avoid \"free-riders\" (Petersen 2012, Aaroe and Petersen 2014). These \"CARIN\" criteria primarily attend to cues about whether recipients cannot help their circumstances, or whether they are seeking unearned benefits. They refer to: *control,* which in its original conception was closely related to *need*, referring to whether someone is perceived as lazy or unlucky – a consideration Oorschot (2006) argues can override all others. More recently, perception of a group or individual’s *need* for assistance has considered the severity of their neediness and *control,* or the degree to which they are responsible (SoRelle and Laws 2024). Perceptions of the group’s *attitude* refer to whether the beneficiary is grateful and likeable, and closely related perceptions of the group’s *reciprocity* connote their history or apparent willingness to contribute to society. Last, the *identity* characteristic holds that people will evaluate more generously the deservingness of others whose identity is aligned with their own (Oorschot 2000, 2006).\n\nDo experiences with policy change how these constructions and characteristics are interpreted? While the deservingness literature on this is limited, there is some evidence it can. In the context of student debt relief, SoRelle and Laws (2023) find that people who have had student loans themselves view borrowers as more deserving of debt forgiveness – reflecting perceived closeness of \"identity.\" In the context of welfare, Maltby and Kreitzer (2022) find that such solidaristic effects of policy experience begin to erode when individuals consider beneficiaries of welfare programs that are *different* than one's own – a finding social constructionists may note reflects \"stickiness\" or persistence of negative constructions, and tendency elevate “deserving” subgroups within an \"undeserving\" population while further stigmatizing others (Schneider and Ingram 1990, Matos 2019). While one recent study (Maltby and Kreitzer 2022) take up the question of carceral contact's effect on target deservingness, several limitations in the design raise questions about whether their findings reflect a measurement artifact.\\[\\^MK\\]\n\nAt the same time, recent work suggests deservingness does not always translate into support for policy. Schneider and Ingram (2019) note that even \"deviant\" groups – long presumed to be negatively constructed – can become beneficiaries of policy help, especially when cossts, visibility, or broader group associations shift. Likewise, SoRelle and Laws (2023) observe that deservingness perceptions may not linearly translate into support for policy overall. Together, these insights highlight the need to examine not just whether contact reshapes deservingness perceptions, but whether and how those perceptions relate to support for state intervention.\n\nThe criminal legal system is a unique context for studying these questions. Its high costs, high visibility, and moral - including life and death - charge, and cumulative burdens prompt scholars to study \"policy contact\" not only in terms of direct contact – e.g. arrest, incarceration, fines and fees. It is also studied in terms of proximate exposure, such as the experiences of the disproportionately Black, Latinx, and low-income social networks and neighborhhoods of the incarcerated (Baumbartner, Epp, and Shoub 2018; Davenport, Soule, and Armstrong 2011, Western et al 2004, Massoglia 2008). To better understand how both direct and proximate criminal legal contact may shape perceptions of targets of the system's targets, how contact may shape views on criminal legal policy, and the link between the two, I turn next to insights from the policy feedback literature.\n\n#### Policy Feedback\n\nFeedback scholars show that across domains, policies have the capacity to shape and reshape subsequent policy landscapes (Skocpol 1992, Campbell 2012). This increasingly wide-reaching scholarship shows that whether responding to visible or hidden policy, or producing first or second-order actual or noneffects, such \"feedbacks\" operate through two broad mechanisms (Mettler 2011, Soss and Schram 2007, SoRelle 2020, 2021). First, policies create resource effects: policies distribute benefits and imposing costs that can alter political capacities, and create incentives or disincentives to political engagement – costs incurred in domains that are not strictly \"political\" have political ramifications (Campbell 2003, Mettler 2005). Similarly, \"interpretive\" effects connote the ability of policy design and implementation to convey messages to it's targets about what they can expect and may ask of government as a whole. This interpretive element involves but is distinct from social construction theory, in that it stresses the messages a policy target translates from interacting with policy, rather than the more general messages conveyed *about* targets from policy.\n\nImportantly, scholars note that targets can respond to policy design by rejecting a negative construction or message imbued in or derived from it, and engage in collective action (Goss 2013, Thurston 2018, SoRelle 2020, Lacombe 2021). Of course, this is not always the case: Soss (1999) explains a tendancy of recipients of means-tested welfare (AFDC) to maintain negative constructions about beneficiaries of the same policy (unlike recipients of the non-means tested disability benefits) as a product of political learning while on the AFDC: benefits are burdensome to access, involve stringent behavioral monitoring, and involve more caseworker discretion than standardized rules, conveying to AFDC beneficiaries that government views them as responsible for their need and untrustworthy. This leads beneficiaries to not only internalize a more \"undeserving\" perception of their own beneficiary group, but also splinters any sense of group solidarity and disaggregates policy views from perceptions of beneficiary deservingness.\n\nFurther, feedback scholarship dilineates distinct processes and outcomes for with people with direct contact versus those with indirect (or \"proximate) contact such families of targets and neighborhood effects. This is particularly so in the literature on policy feedbacks of the carceral state. At the neighborhood level, Burch (2014) finds that high concentrations of incarceration and community supervision reduce political participation, creating \"important spillover effects that suppress participation not only of the supervised individual but also of those living around him or her\" (197). Lee et al. (2014) highight that such 'spillovers' involve the families and loved ones of incarcerated people, who incur both 'direct' and 'indirect' resource effects via costs of visitation and communication, and supporting loved ones' commissary or paying off fines and fees. Compounded with embittering policy messages, these effects translate to less ability and interest in political participation, as the proximally impacted understand government as failing to work for or listen to them, and setting their loved one's up to fail.\n\nYet, others find that proximal spillovers can politically mobilize (Lawless and Fox 2001, Owens 2014, Walker 2014). Walker and García-Castañon (2017) find that for women of color especially, caregiving responsibilities for incarcerated loved ones can become politicized labor leading to increased non-electoral political participation. Anoll and Israel-Trummel (2019) find evidence such proximate mobilization is a produce of “surrogate” participation, or a motivation to participate specifically on behalf of or *due* to the disenfranchisement or incarceration of another. In another study of neighborhood effects, Anoll et all (2022) find that visible forms of policing politically mobilize specifically when they are understood as racially discriminatory.\n\nWhile *direct* contact with the carceral system has traditionally been understood to depress political participation via resource and interpretive mechanisms, scholars increasingly find that responses to these mechanisms are not unidirectional (Comfort 2008, Page et al 2019). Lerman and Weaver (2014) find that court, police, and prison encounters foster government distrust and perceptions of a reduced civic status, thereby \"actively construct\\[ing\\] a different citizenship. Others have reinforced and extended these findings, noting that even brief stints in jail (White 2019) or more 'routine' interactions like traffic stops diminish political engagement (Ben-Menachem and Morris 2023).\n\nAs with proximally impacted individuals, people directly affected by the carceral system sometimes respond to policy contact with political mobilization rather than withdrawal – although the messages conveyed and resource burdens imposed by policy remain unchanged (Rosenthhal and Farhart 2023). Owens and Walker (2018), for example, find that connections to civil society organizations can increase non-voting political participation among those with the heaviest criminal justice contact, suggesting institutional factors may mediate feedback effects, they and others emphasize that criminal legal contact mobilizes *despite* diminished institutional trust, and because of perceptions of procedural unfairness towards one's group – an apparent perception of deserving better (Owens 2014, Walker 2020). Thus, mobilization in response to both direct and proximal contact involve meaning-making processes that wed social solidarity with dampened perceptions of institutional legitimacy and trust – what Walker (2020) terms a sense of \"systemic injustice.\"\n\nWhile these studies have established that contact with criminal legal policies and institutions shapes political behavior and attitudes toward the state, they do not examine victimization as a form of contact. This is a notable omission, given both the overlap between victimized and policed/incarcerated communities, attention to it's potential to introduce endogeneity into analyses (e.g. Lerman and Weaver 2014, Weaver and Lerman 2010, Michener 2018), and broader public policy context in which the interests of victims are often positioned as antithetical to those of offenders. Similarly, while scholars have debated the partisan affiliation of carceral citizens (Burch 2011, Uggen and Manza 2006), far less is known about how criminal legal contact affects policy preferences, and the extent to which attitudes toward the targets of the criminal legal system themselves mediate them. I will briefly turn next to relevant literature on victimization, before expanding on my theoretical.\n\nIn political rhetoric, victims are framed as proponents of punitive policies and often invoked to justify carceral expansion — seen, for example, in “Laken Riley Act” – on the assumption their interests align with retribution. This logic is not confined to politicians: much of the early literature on public opinion and crime policy either implicitly or explicitly adopts a model in which victimization produces retributive impulses and policy preferences aimed at restoring order through state coercion. Yet empirical studies challenge this assumption. Kleck and Jackson (2016) find that victimization does not consistently increase punitiveness. Instead, victims often express preferences for policy solutions that offer support and prevention rather than punishment. Research on victim compensation shows that many victims prioritize services, recognition, or healing over retribution (Shapland 1984), and may prioritize social investments in addressing root causes of crime, such as poverty and community disinvestment, over punishment (ASJ 2024). More broadly, Fresh (2024) finds that the rise of punitive attitudes in the late twentieth century was not simply a response to crime rates or victimization, but was structured by racialized political appeals that mobilized white voters, particularly in the South. Together, these findings suggest that victims may hold complex policy views and may diverge in reality from narratives used to justify their punishment-oriented representation.\n\nAlthough victims of crime are rarely theorized as policy feedback subjects, the concept of victimization is implicitly central to the literature. Policy feedback scholars routinely emphasize how individuals interpret state actions—especially punitive or discriminatory ones—as signals of exclusion, abandonment, or devaluation (Soss 1999; Lerman and Weaver 2014). These “interpretive effects” can leave people feeling targeted, disrespected, or undeserving in the eyes of the state. In this sense, experiences of secondary victimization—such as being disbelieved, ignored, or emotionally constrained by the criminal justice process (Lens et al. 2014) — can function much like the demobilizing interpretive effects faced by other negatively constructed policy targets. Yet unlike welfare recipients or formerly incarcerated people, crime victims are more often assumed to support the very policies and institutions that may reproduce their harm. Recognizing victimization as a site of policy experience—and potential interpretive rupture—opens new terrain for understanding how contact shapes not just institutional trust or political engagement, but also perceptions of who deserves help or harm from the state. This paper takes up that challenge by including victimization in it's analysis of other forms of c\n\nIn other policy domains, scholars have shown that people's beliefs about whether a target group is *deserving* or policy help or of punishment play an important role in shaping how they think about policy towards that group.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nFrom Intro\n\nwhether those who are \"closest to the pain\" or have first-hand experience with policy differ in their views on policy from those who do not.\n\non evidence that *responses to* the criminal legal system’s policy messages vary, and specifically that some respond to the negative messages transmitted by criminal legal policy with dubiousness towards state legitimacy suggest perceptions of what its targets deserve may vary as well (Walker 2020, Harris 2025).\n\nTo do so, I a Drawing on both frameworks, I theorize that as carceral contact can drive perceptions of carceral state *il*legitimacy and distrust, it may too engender warmer perceptions of carceral targets – disrupting dominant discursive cues about\n\nFurther still, direct and proximal contact in the form of both incarceration and victimization may allow for more nuanced perceptions of who carceral targets are and what policy help they, or the interest of public justice and safety, need – irregardless of carceral targets perceived deserving status.

Policy directly shapes these constructions, as it produces both resource and interpretive feedback effects that are part of the discourse that shapes constructions. In forming opinions about policy and deciding what inequalities are tolerable, publics draw on salient social constructions about the relevant policy target and use them in a heuristic process to quickly determine whether a target is “deserving” of help (citation). Theoretically, then these judgements translate to, or at play in the formation of, beliefs about criminal legal policy.\n\nHere, I suggest that this loop between policy design and the messages it transmits about what it’s targets deserve may be interrupted for some citizens due to their connections to those who are justice involved, Emerging evidence that *responses to* the criminal legal system’s policy messages vary, and specifically that some respond to the negative messages transmitted by criminal legal policy with dubiousness towards state legitimacy suggest perceptions of what its targets deserve may vary as well (Walker 2020, Harris 2025).\n\n--\n\n--\n\nPervasive, racialized (Ghandnooshh 2014) and dehumanized sterotypes about carceral citizens () tend to motivate harsh assessments of in such contexts as juries (Levinson 2007, Levinson et al 2010), sentencing decisions (Rehavi and Starr 2014) and assessments of culpability (Donovan 2007, Israel-Trummel and Streeter 2021), suggesting that more information may translate to more measured perceptions of carceral citizens. But this might of course go the other way.\n\nGiven evidence that information about carceral citizens like conviction status can decrease support for policy help, this may not always be the case (Uggen and Manza 2006).\n\nIn seeking to understand how the criminal legal system shapes and reshapes politics, policy feedback literature has under-examined how victimization factors into behavioral and attitudinal outcomes of the incarcerated and their networks, as well as feedback effects that result from coming in contact with the system as a victim of crime.\n\nIt is useful to begin by considering broad patterns of deservingness scores. I anticipate these scores will be higher for respondents with criminal legal contact, but vary across types. Table X presents these scores in column A, and as a reference column B shows deservingness scores for the aggregated dispositional group. To evaluate the effect of criminal legal contact on desesrvingness perceptions, I perform \\[multiple\\] regressions while controlling for attitudinal conditions and demographic and political factors.\n\nIt is useful to begin by considering broad patterns of deservingness scores.

By year-end 2001, more than 5.6 million U.S. adults had served time in a state or federal prison (BOP 2003), and by 2010, an estimated 8 % of adults in the US had a felony conviction and 3 % had served or were serving prison time (Shannon et al 2017). While systematized data on non-felony convictions remain, as Stenson and Mayson (2018) put it, \"absurdly, embarassingly\" (p. 732) elusive, they estimate 13.2 million such cases are filed annually. Many millions more experience incarceration indirectly – through proximal contact – as family, friends, or neighbors of those incarcerated – or through victimization, having been harmed by a crime prosecuted by the state.\n\nThis widespread direct and proximal carceral contact with the carceral state has generated a growing body of scholarship that attempts to understand how contact with this particular state policy feeds back to shape attitudes towards the state (Lerman and Weaver 2014), political identities (Owens 2014), and political engagement (White 2019). Implicit in much of this literature is the contention that feedbacks matter not only because they reshape political participation, but because they may influence what citizens come to demand from the state — and thus subsequent policy outcomes (Skocpol 1992, Mettler and SoRelle 2023). Yet, while this theoretical possibility is widely acknowledged, most empirical studies have probed strictly electoral consequences (Manza and Uggen 2006, Burch 2011), leaving open questions of how contact with the carceral state shapes individuals' views *on criminal legal policy itself* (White 2022). Moreover, while the overlap between those targeted by the criminal legal system and victims, in behalf of whose interest it purportedly acts, is well-established (Godsoe 2022), little is known about feedback effects of victimization.\n\nAt the same time, scholars across policy domains have shown that public support for state intervention is shaped by beliefs about whether a given target group is *deserving* (Ellis and Faricy 2019, DeSante 2013). Further still, such 'deservingness perceptions' often predict state policy outcomes (Kreitzer, Maltby and Smith 2022). These perceptions are not purely personal – they shape and are shaped by policy design (Schneider and Ingram 2019). Yet, their direct role in shaping opinions of *criminal legal policy* – and how they are shaped *by* contact with criminal legal policy – remains undertheorized and empirically underexamined.\n\nThis paper brings these frameworks together to address these three gaps. I explore how direct and proximal experiences with the carceral state shape perceptions of what incarcerated people deserve – and how or whether their effects on perceptions of deservingness, broadly conceived, translate to opinions on policy. Building on both liness of scholarship, I theorize that carceral contact may disrupt dominant discursive cues about who incarcerated people are and what they deserve. Further still, I draw suggest that contact may change *how* individuals *respond* to such cues – or constructions of carceral citizens – loosening the relationship between deservingness and policy preferences altogether, especially when contact fosters distrust in the legitimacy of the state itself (Walker 2020, Harris 2025).\n\nI test these propositions using original 2024 survey data capturing Americans' experiences with the carceral system, their perceptions of a range of policy targets, and their attitudes towards prison-related policy reforms. The data allow for a unique empirical examination of how deservingness judgementss may vary across direct and indirect experiences with incarceration and victimization – and how these judgements structure policy preferences.\n\nIn doing so, this paper makes three contributions. First, it extends theories of social constructions and deservingness – the latter of which was largely developed in the context of welfare and redistributive policy - into the domain of criminal legal policy. Second, it sheds new light on how policy or institutional experience and proximity modifies deservingness perceptions and their correspondence to *substantive policy views* – allowing for a contribution to our understanding of policy feedback of the carceral state. Last, it responds to recent interventions that experiences of victimization constitute a critical but understudied component of this feedback loop (Levine and Russell 2023) and deepens our understanding of how it – in relation to direct and proximal contact, and as a kind of proximal contact of it's own – can alter the public's orientation toward punishment, policy, and state legitimacy. More broadly, these findings are useful to audiences outside of the strictly academic domain. Policymakers and advocates for criminal legal policy reform increasingly target the exclusion of those \"closest to the pain,\" or with first-hand experience with the carceral state, from from agenda-setting, policy making, and policy implementation (see [Pressley 2023](https://pressley.house.gov/2023/12/06/pressley-welch-unveil-historic-bill-to-guarantee-right-to-vote-for-incarcerated-citizens/)). Understanding how impacted groups differ in their approach to policy – and whether the preferences of most victims and perpetrators are as far apart as dominant narratives would suggest – may be particularly useful in this domain.\n\nThe remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. In section 2, I elaborate first on key findings from social constructions, deservingness, and policy feedback literature, with particular attention to how they inform expectations about criminal legal policy. Section 3 develops theoretical framework, outlining how carceral contact may shape perceptions of deservingness and how those perceptions may, in turn, influence policy views. Section 4 then presents the data and analytic strategy, drawing on a newly fielded national survey to test these relationships. I conclude in section 5 with a brief discussion of implications for theories of deservingness, policy feedback, the politics of punishment.\n\n. . .\n\n## Literature\n\nHow does contact with the criminal legal system affect perceptions of its targets? And what do these deservingness perceptions mean for policy views? These questions intersect with two literatures. First, scholarship on social constructions and deservingness examines how groups become characterized as deserving or undeserving of government assistance, and shows that both policy views and outcomes hinge on such characterizations (Schneider and Ingram 1993, Smith and Kreitzer 2024, Oorschot 2006). While this literature leaves open the question of how experiences with policy might alter characterizations about it's targets, lessons from policy feedback literature suggest they might. Across domains, including the carceral state, policy feedback literature shows that policies can shape attitudes towards the state and institutions, one's sense of \"civic self,\" and political behavior through \"resource\" and \"interpretive\" effects (see Mettler and SoRelle 2023, White 2022). In the criminal legal domain, scholars find that these effects culminate in diminished trust in the state, but increasingly debate when and why targets respond not with political withdrawal, but with apparant reappraisal – of both the state and the messages it sends about it's targets (Walker 2020, Anoll et al 2019). As we will see, much of this work maintains an interest in but does test how how direct or proximal criminal legal contact shapes attitudes not towards the state, but rather what it's targets deserve from it. I briefly review these literatures below.\n\n#### SCOTP\n\nIn the wake of Schneider and Ingram's (1993) theory of social constructions, scholars have coalesced around the idea that attitudes towards policy targets are in dialectic with policy. That is, policy design not only has \"interpretive effects\" on its targets but also shapes discourse *about* them. In this way, policy can \"telegraph to the public how target groups should be treated,\" and helps to produce social constructions or \"value-laden components, including stereotypes, dominant ideologies, and assumptions\" about groups (Smith and Kreitzer 2024, PAGE). As consequence, social constructions are contingent. They are contingent, for example, on local, state, and political and cultural contexts and also on the political identity of and ideology held by the 'perceiver' (Smith and Kreitzer 2018, 768). This means both that policy can *reflect* existing social constructions, and that it can feed back to causally affect further social constructions of who targets are. The notion of who targets *are* in turn affects how people perceive what they *should* receive – i.e., what they deserve. These perceptions matter because they are theorized to be understood as policy preferences and translated by policymakers into policy that helps or hinders groups, reinforcing their social constructions (Schneider and ingram 2019).\n\n#### CARIN\n\nA related stream of literature explains that people form quick judgements about policy targets' deservingness by evaluating constructions along five dimensions in an evolutionarily-grounded impulse to help \"reciprocators\" and avoid \"free-riders\" (Petersen 2012, Aaroe and Petersen 2014). These \"CARIN\" criteria primarily attend to cues about whether recipients cannot help their circumstances, or whether they are seeking unearned benefits. They refer to: *control,* which in its original conception was closely related to *need*, referring to whether someone is perceived as lazy or unlucky – a consideration Oorschot (2006) argues can override all others. More recently, perception of a group or individual’s *need* for assistance has considered the severity of their neediness and *control,* or the degree to which they are responsible (SoRelle and Laws 2024). Perceptions of the group’s *attitude* refer to whether the beneficiary is grateful and likeable, and closely related perceptions of the group’s *reciprocity* connote their history or apparent willingness to contribute to society. Last, the *identity* characteristic holds that people will evaluate more generously the deservingness of others whose identity is aligned with their own (Oorschot 2000, 2006).\n\nDo experiences with policy change how these constructions and characteristics are interpreted? While the deservingness literature on this is limited, there is some evidence it can. In the context of student debt relief, SoRelle and Laws (2023) find that people who have had student loans themselves view borrowers as more deserving of debt forgiveness – reflecting perceived closeness of \"identity.\" In the context of welfare, Maltby and Kreitzer (2022) find that such solidaristic effects of policy experience begin to erode when individuals consider beneficiaries of welfare programs that are *different* than one's own – a finding social constructionists may note reflects \"stickiness\" or persistence of negative constructions, and tendency elevate “deserving” subgroups within an \"undeserving\" population while further stigmatizing others (Schneider and Ingram 1990, Matos 2019). While one recent study (Maltby and Kreitzer 2022) take up the question of carceral contact's effect on target deservingness, several limitations in the design raise questions about whether their findings reflect a measurement artifact.\\[\\^MK\\]\n\nAt the same time, recent work suggests deservingness does not always translate into support for policy. Schneider and Ingram (2019) note that even \"deviant\" groups – long presumed to be negatively constructed – can become beneficiaries of policy help, especially when cossts, visibility, or broader group associations shift. Likewise, SoRelle and Laws (2023) observe that deservingness perceptions may not linearly translate into support for policy overall. Together, these insights highlight the need to examine not just whether contact reshapes deservingness perceptions, but whether and how those perceptions relate to support for state intervention.\n\nThe criminal legal system is a unique context for studying these questions. Its high costs, high visibility, and moral - including life and death - charge, and cumulative burdens prompt scholars to study \"policy contact\" not only in terms of direct contact – e.g. arrest, incarceration, fines and fees. It is also studied in terms of proximate exposure, such as the experiences of the disproportionately Black, Latinx, and low-income social networks and neighborhhoods of the incarcerated (Baumbartner, Epp, and Shoub 2018; Davenport, Soule, and Armstrong 2011, Western et al 2004, Massoglia 2008). To better understand how both direct and proximate criminal legal contact may shape perceptions of targets of the system's targets, how contact may shape views on criminal legal policy, and the link between the two, I turn next to insights from the policy feedback literature.\n\n#### Policy Feedback\n\nFeedback scholars show that across domains, policies have the capacity to shape and reshape subsequent policy landscapes (Skocpol 1992, Campbell 2012). This increasingly wide-reaching scholarship shows that whether responding to visible or hidden policy, or producing first or second-order actual or noneffects, such \"feedbacks\" operate through two broad mechanisms (Mettler 2011, Soss and Schram 2007, SoRelle 2020, 2021). First, policies create resource effects: policies distribute benefits and imposing costs that can alter political capacities, and create incentives or disincentives to political engagement – costs incurred in domains that are not strictly \"political\" have political ramifications (Campbell 2003, Mettler 2005). Similarly, \"interpretive\" effects connote the ability of policy design and implementation to convey messages to it's targets about what they can expect and may ask of government as a whole. This interpretive element involves but is distinct from social construction theory, in that it stresses the messages a policy target translates from interacting with policy, rather than the more general messages conveyed *about* targets from policy.\n\nImportantly, scholars note that targets can respond to policy design by rejecting a negative construction or message imbued in or derived from it, and engage in collective action (Goss 2013, Thurston 2018, SoRelle 2020, Lacombe 2021). Of course, this is not always the case: Soss (1999) explains a tendancy of recipients of means-tested welfare (AFDC) to maintain negative constructions about beneficiaries of the same policy (unlike recipients of the non-means tested disability benefits) as a product of political learning while on the AFDC: benefits are burdensome to access, involve stringent behavioral monitoring, and involve more caseworker discretion than standardized rules, conveying to AFDC beneficiaries that government views them as responsible for their need and untrustworthy. This leads beneficiaries to not only internalize a more \"undeserving\" perception of their own beneficiary group, but also splinters any sense of group solidarity and disaggregates policy views from perceptions of beneficiary deservingness.\n\nFurther, feedback scholarship dilineates distinct processes and outcomes for with people with direct contact versus those with indirect (or \"proximate) contact such families of targets and neighborhood effects. This is particularly so in the literature on policy feedbacks of the carceral state. At the neighborhood level, Burch (2014) finds that high concentrations of incarceration and community supervision reduce political participation, creating \"important spillover effects that suppress participation not only of the supervised individual but also of those living around him or her\" (197). Lee et al. (2014) highight that such 'spillovers' involve the families and loved ones of incarcerated people, who incur both 'direct' and 'indirect' resource effects via costs of visitation and communication, and supporting loved ones' commissary or paying off fines and fees. Compounded with embittering policy messages, these effects translate to less ability and interest in political participation, as the proximally impacted understand government as failing to work for or listen to them, and setting their loved one's up to fail.\n\nYet, others find that proximal spillovers can politically mobilize (Lawless and Fox 2001, Owens 2014, Walker 2014). Walker and García-Castañon (2017) find that for women of color especially, caregiving responsibilities for incarcerated loved ones can become politicized labor leading to increased non-electoral political participation. Anoll and Israel-Trummel (2019) find evidence such proximate mobilization is a produce of “surrogate” participation, or a motivation to participate specifically on behalf of or *due* to the disenfranchisement or incarceration of another. In another study of neighborhood effects, Anoll et all (2022) find that visible forms of policing politically mobilize specifically when they are understood as racially discriminatory.\n\nWhile *direct* contact with the carceral system has traditionally been understood to depress political participation via resource and interpretive mechanisms, scholars increasingly find that responses to these mechanisms are not unidirectional (Comfort 2008, Page et al 2019). Lerman and Weaver (2014) find that court, police, and prison encounters foster government distrust and perceptions of a reduced civic status, thereby \"actively construct\\[ing\\] a different citizenship. Others have reinforced and extended these findings, noting that even brief stints in jail (White 2019) or more 'routine' interactions like traffic stops diminish political engagement (Ben-Menachem and Morris 2023).\n\nAs with proximally impacted individuals, people directly affected by the carceral system sometimes respond to policy contact with political mobilization rather than withdrawal – although the messages conveyed and resource burdens imposed by policy remain unchanged (Rosenthhal and Farhart 2023). Owens and Walker (2018), for example, find that connections to civil society organizations can increase non-voting political participation among those with the heaviest criminal justice contact, suggesting institutional factors may mediate feedback effects, they and others emphasize that criminal legal contact mobilizes *despite* diminished institutional trust, and because of perceptions of procedural unfairness towards one's group – an apparent perception of deserving better (Owens 2014, Walker 2020). Thus, mobilization in response to both direct and proximal contact involve meaning-making processes that wed social solidarity with dampened perceptions of institutional legitimacy and trust – what Walker (2020) terms a sense of \"systemic injustice.\"\n\nWhile these studies have established that contact with criminal legal policies and institutions shapes political behavior and attitudes toward the state, they do not examine victimization as a form of contact. This is a notable omission, given both the overlap between victimized and policed/incarcerated communities, attention to it's potential to introduce endogeneity into analyses (e.g. Lerman and Weaver 2014, Weaver and Lerman 2010, Michener 2018), and broader public policy context in which the interests of victims are often positioned as antithetical to those of offenders. Similarly, while scholars have debated the partisan affiliation of carceral citizens (Burch 2011, Uggen and Manza 2006), far less is known about how criminal legal contact affects policy preferences, and the extent to which attitudes toward the targets of the criminal legal system themselves mediate them. I will briefly turn next to relevant literature on victimization, before expanding on my theoretical.\n\nIn political rhetoric, victims are framed as proponents of punitive policies and often invoked to justify carceral expansion — seen, for example, in “Laken Riley Act” – on the assumption their interests align with retribution. This logic is not confined to politicians: much of the early literature on public opinion and crime policy either implicitly or explicitly adopts a model in which victimization produces retributive impulses and policy preferences aimed at restoring order through state coercion. Yet empirical studies challenge this assumption. Kleck and Jackson (2016) find that victimization does not consistently increase punitiveness. Instead, victims often express preferences for policy solutions that offer support and prevention rather than punishment. Research on victim compensation shows that many victims prioritize services, recognition, or healing over retribution (Shapland 1984), and may prioritize social investments in addressing root causes of crime, such as poverty and community disinvestment, over punishment (ASJ 2024). More broadly, Fresh (2024) finds that the rise of punitive attitudes in the late twentieth century was not simply a response to crime rates or victimization, but was structured by racialized political appeals that mobilized white voters, particularly in the South. Together, these findings suggest that victims may hold complex policy views and may diverge in reality from narratives used to justify their punishment-oriented representation.\n\nAlthough victims of crime are rarely theorized as policy feedback subjects, the concept of victimization is implicitly central to the literature. Policy feedback scholars routinely emphasize how individuals interpret state actions—especially punitive or discriminatory ones—as signals of exclusion, abandonment, or devaluation (Soss 1999; Lerman and Weaver 2014). These “interpretive effects” can leave people feeling targeted, disrespected, or undeserving in the eyes of the state. In this sense, experiences of secondary victimization—such as being disbelieved, ignored, or emotionally constrained by the criminal justice process (Lens et al. 2014) — can function much like the demobilizing interpretive effects faced by other negatively constructed policy targets. Yet unlike welfare recipients or formerly incarcerated people, crime victims are more often assumed to support the very policies and institutions that may reproduce their harm. Recognizing victimization as a site of policy experience—and potential interpretive rupture—opens new terrain for understanding how contact shapes not just institutional trust or political engagement, but also perceptions of who deserves help or harm from the state. This paper takes up that challenge by including victimization in it's analysis of other forms of c\n\nIn other policy domains, scholars have shown that people's beliefs about whether a target group is *deserving* or policy help or of punishment play an important role in shaping how they think about policy towards that group.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":false,"output":true,"warning":false,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":true,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"produce-source-notebook":true,"notebook-preserve-cells":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"other_scratch.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
