While this literature leaves open the question of how experiences with policy might alter characterizations about it's targets,

### SCOTP

Social construction scholarship takes up deservingness in a framework that sees perceptions of deservingness as contingent less on individual mechanisms within a “perceiver” and objective realities of a target, but instead as the name suggests, on constructs about the target. Importantly, it locates perceptions of deservingness as not only drivers of individual policy opinion, but also of policy outcomes which in turn can reproduce social constructions.

While the deservingness literature on this is limited, there is some evidence it can. In the context of student debt relief, SoRelle and Laws (2023) find that people who have had student loans themselves view borrowers as more deserving of debt forgiveness – reflecting perceived closeness of "identity." In the context of welfare, Maltby and Kreitzer (2022) find that such solidaristic effects of policy experience begin to erode when individuals consider beneficiaries of welfare programs that are *different* than one's own – a finding social constructionists may note reflects "stickiness" or persistence of negative constructions, and tendency elevate “deserving” subgroups within an "undeserving" population while further stigmatizing others (Schneider and Ingram 1990, Matos 2019). While one recent study (Maltby and Kreitzer 2022) take up the question of carceral contact's effect on target deservingness, several limitations in the design raise questions about whether their findings reflect a measurement artifact.\[\^1\]

### POLICY FEEDBACK

To do so, I ask how direct and proximate experiences of incarceration and victimization shape perceptions of the deservingness of incarcerated people, and whether these perceptions translate to opinions on prison policy.

The criminal legal system is a unique context for studying these questions. Its high costs, high visibility, and moral - including life and death - charge, and cumulative burdens prompt scholars to study "policy contact" not only in terms of direct contact – e.g. arrest, incarceration, fines and fees. It is also studied in terms of proximate exposure, such as the experiences of the disproportionately Black, Latinx, and low-income social networks and neighborhhoods of the incarcerated (Baumbartner, Epp, and Shoub 2018; Davenport, Soule, and Armstrong 2011, Western et al 2004, Massoglia 2008).

To better understand how both direct and proximate criminal legal contact may shape perceptions of targets of the system's targets, how contact may shape views on criminal legal policy, and the link between the two, I turn next to insights from the policy feedback literature.

Further, feedback scholarship dilineates distinct processes and outcomes for with people with direct contact versus those with indirect (or proximate) contact such as families of targets and neighborhood effects. For example, Burch (2014) finds that high concentrations of incarceration and community supervision reduce political participation, creating “important spillover effects that suppress participation not only of the supervised individual but also of those living around him or her” (197). Lee et al. (2014) highight that such ‘spillovers’ involve the families and loved ones of incarcerated people, who incur both ‘direct’ and ‘indirect’ resource effects via costs of visitation and communication, and supporting loved ones’ commissary or paying off fines and fees. Compounded with embittering policy messages, these effects translate to less ability and interest in political participation, as the proximally impacted understand government as failing to work for or listen to them, and setting their loved one’s up to fail.

Yet, others find that proximal spillovers can politically mobilize (Lawless and Fox 2001, Owens 2014, Walker 2014). Walker and García-Castañon (2017) find that for women of color especially, caregiving responsibilities for incarcerated loved ones can become politicized labor leading to increased non-electoral political participation. Anoll and Israel-Trummel (2019) find evidence such proximate mobilization is a produce of “surrogate” participation, or a motivation to participate specifically on behalf of or *due* to the disenfranchisement or incarceration of another. In another study of neighborhood effects, Anoll et all (2022) find that visible forms of policing politically mobilize specifically when they are understood as racially discriminatory.

While *direct* contact with the carceral system has traditionally been understood to depress political participation via resource and interpretive mechanisms, scholars increasingly find that responses to these mechanisms are not unidirectional (Comfort 2008, Page et al 2019). Lerman and Weaver (2014) find that court, police, and prison encounters foster government distrust and perceptions of a reduced civic status, thereby "actively construct\[ing\] a different citizenship. Others have reinforced and extended these findings, noting that even brief stints in jail (White 2019) or more 'routine' interactions like traffic stops diminish political engagement (Ben-Menachem and Morris 2023).

As with proximally impacted individuals, people directly affected by the carceral system sometimes respond to policy contact with political mobilization rather than withdrawal – although the messages conveyed and resource burdens imposed by policy remain unchanged (Rosenthhal and Farhart 2023). Owens and Walker (2018), for example, find that connections to civil society organizations can increase non-voting political participation among those with the heaviest criminal justice contact, suggesting institutional factors may mediate feedback effects, they and others emphasize that criminal legal contact mobilizes *despite* diminished institutional trust, and because of perceptions of procedural unfairness towards one's group – an apparent perception of deserving better (Owens 2014, Walker 2020). Thus, mobilization in response to both direct and proximal contact involve meaning-making processes that wed social solidarity with dampened perceptions of institutional legitimacy and trust – what Walker (2020) terms a sense of "systemic injustice."

While the literature has productively distinguished between direct and proximate contact, feedback scholars also acknowledge endogeneity challenges inherent to such categorizations in a context of "cumulative burdens" (Lerman and Weaver 2014; Weaver and Lerman 2010; Michener 2018). Experiences of victimization amplify this tension: they often occur alongside policing and incarceration in the same communities, yet are rarely conceptualized as a form of policy contact in their own right. One notable exception is Levine and Russell (2023), who show how the design and financing of victim compensation law constructs victims as morally deserving and politically worthy, helping expand state responsibility. Yet even here, the analysis centers on state building and symbolic policy meaning—rather than how victimization itself may function as a form of lived experience that may alter how individuals perceive the state, it's targets, and what policies they deserve.

Although victims of crime are rarely theorized as policy feedback subjects, the concept of victimization is implicitly central to the literature. Policy feedback scholars emphasize how individuals interpret state actions—especially punitive or discriminatory ones—as signals of exclusion, abandonment, or devaluation (Soss 1999; Lerman and Weaver 2014). These “interpretive effects” can leave people feeling targeted, disrespected, or undeserving in the eyes of the state. In this context, experiences of secondary victimization—such as being disbelieved, ignored, or emotionally constrained by the criminal justice process (Lens et al. 2014) — can function much like the demobilizing interpretive effects faced by other negatively constructed policy targets. Yet unlike welfare recipients or formerly incarcerated people, crime victims are more often assumed to support the very policies and institutions that may reproduce their harm. Recognizing victimization as a form of state contact—and a potential site of interpretive rupture—opens new terrain for understanding how criminal legal experience shapes not only institutional trust and political participation, but also deservingness perceptions and carceral policy attitudes. This paper takes up that challenge by analyzing victimization alongside other forms of contact to assess how they each influence perceptions of who deserves help or harm—and what role the state should play.
