Literature,1,"How does contact with the criminal legal system affect perceptions of it's targets? And what do these deservingness perceptions mean for policy views? These questions intersect with two literatures. First, scholarship on social constructions and deservingness examine how groups become characterized as deserving or undeserving of government assistance, and theorizes that both policy views and outcomes hinge on such characterizations (Schneider and Ingram 1993, Smith and Kreitzer 2024, Oorschot 2006). While this literature leaves open the question of how individual experiences with policy might alter characterizations about it's targets, lessons from policy feedback literature suggest they might. This closely related literature shows that policies can shape political attitudes and behavior across domains, including that of the carceral state (White 2022). While these scholars have established two broad mechanisms through which carceral contact indeed influences political participation and institutional trust – ""resource"" and ""interpretive"" effects – much less is known about how such contact affects attitudes toward the targets of these policies Specifically, we do not yet understand how direct or proximal experience with incarceration or victimization might reshape perceptions of incarcerated people's deservingness and, in turn, opinions on prison policy. I briefly review these literatures here.",,,
Literature,2,#### SCOTP,,,
Literature,3,"In the wake of Schneider and Ingram's (1993) theory of social constructions, scholars have coalesced around the idea that attitudes towards policy targets are in dialectic with policy. That is, policy design not only has ""interpretive effects"" on its targets but also shapes discourse *about* them. In this way, policy can ""telegraph to the public how target groups should be treated,"" and helps to produce social constructions or ""value-laden components, including stereotypes, dominant ideologies, and assumptions"" about groups (Smith and Kreitzer 2024, PAGE). As consequence, social constructions are contingent. They are contingent, for example, on local, state, and political and cultural contexts and also on the political identity of and ideology held by the 'perceiver' (Smith and Kreitzer 2018). This means both that policy can *reflect* existing social constructions, and that it can feed back to causally affect further social constructions of who targets are. The notion of who targets *are* in turn affects how people perceive what they *should* receive – i.e., what they deserve. These perceptions matter because they are theorized to be understood as policy preferences and translated by policymakers into policy that helps or hinders groups, reinforcing their social constructions (Schneider and ingram 2019).",,,
Literature,4,#### CARIN,,,
Literature,5,"A related stream of literature explains that people form quick judgements about policy targets' deservingness by evaluating constructions along five dimensions in an evolutionarily-grounded impulse to help ""reciprocators"" and avoid ""free-riders"" (Petersen 2012, Aaroe and Petersen 2014). These ""CARIN"" criteria primarily attend to cues about whether recipients cannot help their circumstances, or whether they are seeking unearned benefits. They refer to: *control,* which in its original conception was closely related to *need*, referring to whether someone is perceived as lazy or unlucky – a consideration Oorschot (2006) argues can override all others. More recently, perception of a group or individual’s *need* for assistance has considered the severity of their neediness and *control,* or the degree to which they are responsible (SoRelle and Laws 2024). Perceptions of the group’s *attitude* refer to whether the beneficiary is grateful and likeable, and closely related perceptions of the group’s *reciprocity* connote their history or apparent willingness to contribute to society. Last, the *identity* characteristic holds that people will evaluate more generously the deservingness of others whose identity is aligned with their own (Oorschot 2000, 2006).",,,
Literature,6,"Do experiences with policy change how these constructions and characteristics are interpreted? While the deservingness literature on this is limited, there is some evidence it can. In the context of student debt relief, SoRelle and Laws (2023) find that people who have had student loans themselves view borrowers as more deserving of debt forgiveness – reflecting perceived closeness of ""identity."" Maltby and Kreitzer (2022) find similar effects in the context of welfare, but that such solidaristic effects of policy experience begin to erode when individuals consider beneficiaries of welfare programs that are *different* than one's own – a finding social constructionists may note reflects the ""stickiness"" of negative constructions of target populations and tendencies to construct more 'deserving' subsets within a population while stigmatizing others (Schneider and Ingram 1990, Matos 2019), or deservingness scholars might explain as a product of shared experience changing what information about a group is implicitly available (Feather 1999, 2009). Recently, however, Schneider and Ingram (2019) have noted more complicated dynamics around negatively constructed – specifically, ""deviant"" – groups and SoRelle and Laws (2023) further note that deservingness perceptions may not linearly translate into support for policy overall.",,,
Literature,7,"Given the criminal legal systems particular \[high costs and visibiliy\], scholars note that ""policy contact"" must be understood both in terms of direct contact – arrest, incarceration, fines and fees – and also in terms of proximate contact, or the experiences of the disproportionately Black, Latinx, and low-income social networks and neighborhhoods of the incarcerated (Baumbartner, Epp, and Shoub 2018; Davenport, Soule, and Armstrong 2011, Western et al 2004, Massoglia 2008). A closely related literature on policy feedback offers more insight into this dimension. To better understand how both direct and proximate criminal legal contact may shape perceptions of targets of the system's targets, how contact may shape views on criminal legal policy, and the link between the two, we turn there now.",,,
Literature,8,#### Policy Feedback,,,
Literature,9,"How might policy experience shape social constructions, perceptions of target deservingness, and produce policy preferences?",,,
Literature,10,"Feedback scholars show that across domains, policies have the capacity to shape and reshape subsequent policy landscapes (Skocpol 1992, Campbell 2012). This increasingly wide-reaching scholarship shows that whether responding to visible or hidden policy, or produce first or second-order actual or noneffects, such ""feedbacks"" operate through two broad mechanisms (Mettler 2011, Soss and Schram 2007, SoRelle 2020, 2021). First, policies create resource effects: policies distribute benefits and imposing costs that can alter political capacities, and create incentives or disincentives to political engagement – costs incurred in domains that are not strictly ""political"" have political ramifications (Campbell 2003, Mettler 2005). Similarly, ""interpretive"" effects connote the ability of policy design and implementation to convey messages to it's targets about what they can expect and may ask of government as a whole. This interpretive element involves but is distinct from social construction theory, in that it stresses the messages a policy target translates from interacting with policy, rather than the more general messages conveyed *about* targets from policy.",,,
Literature,11,"It follows that policy feedback scholarship notes that targets may respond to policy design by rejecting a negative construction or message imbued in or derived from it, and engage in collective action (Goss 2013, Thurston 2018, SoRelle 2020, Lacombe 2021). Of course, this is not always the case: Soss (1999) explains a tendancy of recipients of means-tested welfare (AFDC) to maintain negative constructions about beneficiaries of the same policy (unlike recipients of the non-means tested disability benefits) as a product of political learning while on the AFDC: benefits are burdensome to access, involve stringent behavioral monitoring, and involve more caseworker discretion than standardized rules, conveying to AFDC beneficiaries that government views them as responsible for their need and untrustworthy. This leads beneficiaries to not only internalize a more ""undeserving"" perception of their own beneficiary group, but also splinters any sense of group solidarity and disaggregates policy views from perceptions of beneficiary deservingness.",,,
Literature,12,"Further, feedback scholarship dilineates distinct processes and outcomes for with people with direct contact versus those with indirect (or ""proximate) contact such families of targets and neighborhood effects. This is particularly so in the literature on policy feedbacks of the carceral state.",,,
Literature,13,##### Proximal CJ Contact,,,
Literature,14,"At the neighborhood level, Burch (2014) finds that high concentrations of incarceration and community supervision reduce political participation, creating ""important spillover effects that suppress participation not only of the supervised individual but also of those living around him or her"" (197). Lee et al. (2014) highight that such 'spillovers' involve the families and loved ones of incarcerated people, who incur both 'direct' and 'indirect' resource effects via costs of visitation and communication, and supporting loved ones' commissary or paying off fines and fees. Compounded with embittering policy messages, these effects translate to less ability and interest in political participation, as the proximally impacted understand government as failing to work for or listen to them, and setting their loved one's up to fail.",,,
Literature,15,"Yet, others find that proximal spillovers can politically mobilize (Lawless and Fox 2001, Owens 2014, Walker 2014). Walker and García-Castañon (2017) find that for women of color especially, caregiving responsibilities for incarcerated loved ones can become politicized labor leading to increased non-electoral political participation. Anoll and Israel-Trummel (2019) find evidence such proximate mobilization is a produce of “surrogate” participation, or a motivation to participate specifically on behalf of or *due* to the disenfranchisement or incarceration of another. In another study of neighborhood effects, Anoll et all (2022) find that visible forms of policing politically mobilize specifically when they are understood as racially discriminatory.",,,
Literature,16,##### Direct CJ Contact,,,
Literature,17,"While direct contact with the carceral system has traditionally been understood to depress political participation via resource and interpretive mechanisms, scholars increasingly find that responses to these mechanisms are not unidirectional (Comfort 2008, Page et al 2019). Lerman and Weaver (2014) find that court, police, and prison encounters foster government distrust and perceptions of a reduced civic status, thereby ""actively construct\[ing\] a different citizenship. Others have reinforced and extended these findings, noting that even brief stints in jail (White 2019) or more 'routine' interactions like traffic stops diminish political engagement (Ben-Menachem and Morris 2023).",,,
Literature,18,"As with proximal contact, literature showing that people with directly impacted by the carceral system respond via mobilization note that the messages conveyed and resource burdens imposed by policy remain unchanged and reduce political trust (Rosenthhal and Farhart 2023). While Owens and Walker (2018) find that connections to civil society organizations significantly increase non-voting political participation among those with the heaviest criminal justice contact, suggesting institutional factors may mediate feedback effects, they and others note that criminal legal contact mobilizes despite or because of perceptions of procedural unfairness towards one's group (Owens 2014, Walker 2020). Thus, mobilization in response to both direct and proximal contact involve meaning-making processes that wed social solidarity with dampened perceptions of institutional legitimacy and trust – what Walker (2020) terms a sense of ""systemic injustice."" While these studies have established that contact with criminal legal policies and institutions shapes political behavior and attitudes toward the state, they do not address victimization as a form of contact – a limitation given the overlap between victimized and policed/incarcerated communities, and a public policy context in which the interests of victims are often positioned as antithetical to those of 'perpetrators.' Further, while scholars have debated the partisan affiliation of carceral citizens (Burch 2011, Uggen and Manza 2006) much less is known about how criminal legal contact affects policy preferences, and the extent to which attitudes toward the targets of the criminal legal system themselves mediate them.",,,
Literature,19,"While Maltby and Kreitzer (2022) take up the question of carceral contact's effect on target deservingness and find that proximal contact does not impact perceptions, X limitations in the study necessitate further examination. First, the study measures criminal legal contact by asking participants whether they or someone they know has been ""arrested or incarcerated."" Given that relatively small policy design and implementation differences can generate to dramatically different effects (citation), combining arrest alone with incarceration (not to mention judicial conviction and sentencing) in a single measure risks nullifying incarceration's distinct resource effects and lessons vis-a-vis one's civic standing and government responsiveness. Further still, an impulse to self-differentiate may motivate individuals who experience arrest alone to maintain distinct narratives — given that contact with policies that convey 'undeserving' messages can motivate beneficiaries to differentiate themselves and their networks from other beneficiaries, for whom they maintain negative social constructions (Soss 2005), and neighborhood inequality motivates a belief in meritocracy for affluent individuals (Newman et al 2014).",,,
Literature,20,"Second, the study reports a dependent variable of perceptions of target deservingness that aggregates perceptions of disparate groups. In other words, it measures perceptions of criminal legal 'target' deservingness as that of ""prisoners,"" but also ""opioid users,"" ""welfare cheats,"" and other groups less apt to the relationships of interest: how policy experience shapes perceptions of policy target deservingness, and the extent to which these perceptions mediate policy opinion.",,,
Literature,21,"Most obviously, under a judicial system that maintains the presumption of innocence and that leverages sentences based on seriousness, individuals who are arrested and individuals who are incarcerated should send very different messages about targets’ deservingness to mass publics and policymakers.",,,
Literature,22,##### Victimization,,,
Literature,23,"Last, while those studying feedback effects of the carceral state note how cumulative burdens and the overlap between victimization and incarceration may introduce endogeneity into analyses, there is relatively little work on feedback effects of crime victimization. Public discourse often frames victims as natural proponents of punitive policies. Legislative appeals—such as the naming of the “Laken Riley Act”—frequently invoke victims to justify carceral expansion or harsher punishment. In this narrative, the interests of victims are positioned as fundamentally opposed to those of the incarcerated: punishment is cast as justice, and reform as neglect of victims’ needs. This assumption is not unique to political rhetoric; much of the early literature on public opinion and crime policy either implicitly or explicitly adopts a model in which victimization produces retributive impulses and policy preferences aimed at restoring order through state coercion.",,,
Literature,24,"Yet empirical studies offer little support for this one-dimensional portrayal. Kleck and Jackson (2016), for example, find that victimization does not consistently increase punitiveness, and that personal experience with crime does not straightforwardly translate into harsher views of criminal justice. Instead, victims often express preferences for policy solutions that offer support and prevention rather than punishment. Research on victim compensation shows that many victims prioritize services, recognition, or healing over retribution (Shapland 1984). More recently, survey and qualitative work suggest that victims are frequently concerned with addressing root causes of crime, such as poverty and community disinvestment (ASJ 2024). Fresh (2024) similarly finds that the rise of punitive attitudes in the late twentieth century was not simply a response to crime rates or victimization, but was structured by racialized political appeals that eclipsed victims’ actual policy preferences. Together, these findings challenge the assumption that victim status naturally aligns with punitiveness—and raise the possibility that victims may hold complex or even reform-oriented views about incarceration and those affected by it.",,,
Literature,25,"Although victims of crime are rarely theorized as policy feedback subjects, the concept of victimization is implicitly central to the literature. Policy feedback scholars routinely emphasize how individuals interpret state actions—especially punitive or discriminatory ones—as signals of exclusion, abandonment, or devaluation (Soss 1999; Lerman and Weaver 2014). These “interpretive effects” can leave people feeling targeted, disrespected, or undeserving in the eyes of the state. In this sense, experiences of secondary victimization—such as being disbelieved, ignored, or emotionally constrained by the criminal justice process (Lens et al. 2014)—can function much like the demobilizing interpretive effects faced by other negatively constructed policy targets. Yet unlike welfare recipients or formerly incarcerated people, crime victims are more often assumed to support the very policies and institutions that may reproduce their harm. Recognizing victimization as a site of policy experience—and potential interpretive rupture—opens new terrain for understanding how contact shapes not just institutional trust or political engagement, but also perceptions of who deserves help or harm from the state.",,,
Theory,1,"How does being directly or proximally impacted by the criminal legal system shape perceptions of what policy carceral citizens deserve? My theoretical starting point is that perceptions of what groups like carceral citizens deserve are often shaped by social constructions about them (Schneider and Ingram 1993). Like stereotypes, these constructions are produced by policy and discourse – both political, cultural, and popular. On the individual level, then, these constructions are often taken up in a heuristic process to form quick judgements about what a target group deserves. Thus, predominant racialized constructions of incarcerated people – “thugs,” “felons,” or “inmates” – suggesting culpable, ungrateful, “takers” responsible for their condition of confinement are likely interpolated as undeserving, translating (following Schneider and Ingram 1993) to support for punitive carceral policy.",,,
Theory,2,"I suggest that contact with the carceral system affects this process (*by/on xyz levels – overview when draft finalized*). Applying insights from the policy feedback literature to matters of target deservingness, I suggest that experience with the criminal legal system – including victimization – leads people to more strongly and consistently support policies that help incarcerated people, and to more nuanced ways of thinking about the relationship between what a carceral target 'deserves' and what policy is appropriate.",,,
Theory,3,"Contact may inform information about targets, (2) attitudes towards targets, (3) attitudes towards criminal legal institutions, and (3) the extent to which typical notions of deservingness dictate judgements about what maes good policy. These factors, I propose, may drive distinct perceptual outcomes and policy preferences between, and more support for policy help across, the three impact groups than ""non-impacted"" constituencies.",,,
Theory,4,#### *(H1A & B) Direct and Proximal Carceral Contact on Target Deservingness*,,,
Theory,5,"By definition, direct impact – incarceration – and proximate impact will change what information individuals have about its targets. Someone who is in and knows people in prison has access to information about who an incarcerated personal is outside of their ""criminal"" identity in a way that someone who has only seen ""prisoners"" on TV may not. This informational effect alone could translate to more generous interpretations of deservingness (Oorschot 2000, 2006, Feather 2009). For example, contact may lead individuals to see incarcerated people as facing substantial hardships (*need*), with less control over the conditions that led to incarceration (*control*), and as capable of gratitude, growth, or giving back (*reciprocity*, *attitude*). In contrast to dominant constructions that depict incarcerated people as undeserving, contact may “fill in” these criteria with lived or vicarious knowledge. On this dimension, then, contact may generate warmer deservingness perceptions by replacing stereotypes with personalized, alternative narratives about who carceral citizens are and what they endure.",,,
Theory,6,"While policy feedback literature shows that many carceral citizens and their networks internalize the clear ""undeserving"" messages that prison policy sends, it also shows that, across contexts where interactions with the criminal legal system mobilize or demobilize, these experiences shape attitudes towards the state (Anoll et al 2022, Anoll and Israel-Trummel 2019, Walker 2020, Lerman and Weaver 2014). As such, I propose that interactions with the criminal legal system should also shape attitudes towards *targets* of the state. While some work finds that targets of policy can internalize negative or undeserving constructions (Soss 1999), much of the work on criminal legal contact stresses that demobilization is a product of resource effects or interpretive effects *distinct* from an “undeserving” self-conception (Lerman and Weaver 2014, White 2019). Instead, other work emphasizes that direct contact with the criminal legal system can heighten in-group solidarity (Lerman and Weaver 2014) and mobilize in spite resource and interpretive feedbacks that should be demobilizing, specifically when policy targets reject policy “teachings” about their lower civic status as part of a sense of systemic injustice – suggesting a perception that the criminal legal system is less legitimate or authoritative, and of its targets as distinctly deserving (Walker 2020).",,,
Theory,7,"Proximal contact also generates political mobilization despite policy experiences that ""should"" demobilize (Anoll et al 2022, White 2019b). Anoll’s (2022) findings that family of the incarcerated vote at higher rates in states with more stringent carceral disenfranchisement policies suggests that “surrogate” mobilization is motivated by a desire to act on behalf a “deserving” incarcerated citizen. Her findings with Israel-Trummel (2019) that neighborhood exposure to racially discriminatory policing generate perceptions of institutional *il*legitimacy – distrust in police and government – suggest exposure should also alter and perhaps enhance perceptions in institutional targets as well.",,,
Theory,8,"Like others (Anoll and Israel-Trummel 2019, Walker 2014), I note that those proximally impacted may be somewhat more removed from undeserving messages than the incarcerated, which should lead to warmer perceptions of carceral deservingness for the proximally than directly impacted. A limitation of this hypothesis is the improbability of people who have been incarcerated not knowing another incarcerated person well.",,,
Theory,9,#### (H1D) No Contact,,,
Theory,10,"Respondents with no direct or proximate experience with incarceration may rely more heavily on dominant public narratives that portray incarcerated individuals as violent, morally deficient, or socially deviant. Social construction theory suggests that, in the absence of countervailing personal experiences, people turn to culturally available representations to evaluate policy targets (Schneider and Ingram 1993; Smith and Kreitzer 2024). In the criminal legal domain, these representations are often shaped by racialized media portrayals and political discourse that emphasize danger and individual blame (Lopez 2015; Vasiljevic and Viki 2014). Without lived or relational knowledge to “fill in” CARIN criteria such as control, reciprocity, or need with humanizing nuance, these respondents are more likely to default to punitive or stigmatized constructions of incarcerated people. Even those who know only victims of crime may be exposed to narratives emphasizing offender culpability and just deserts—without the complexity that comes from understanding incarcerated people as multifaceted individuals. Therefore, I expect that:",,,
Theory,11,"**(H1)** those with direct or proximal experiences with the carceral state will view incarcerated people as more deserving, and **(H1A)** those who know incarcerated people should report the most generosity.",,,
Theory,12,**(H1D)** *Respondents without any direct or proximate carceral contact—including those who know only victims—will express the least generous deservingness perceptions of incarcerated people.*,,,
Theory,13,#### *(H1C) Victimization Effects on Deservingness Perceptions*,,,
Theory,14,"While victimization might intuitively drive negative perceptions of carceral citizens, I suggest the relationship is more complex. Researchers provide evidence that more abstracted, dehumanized stereotypes about carceral citizens (Vasiljevic and Viki 2014) generate harsher assessments of culpability (Levinson 2007, Levinson et al 2010, Donovan 2007, Israel-Trummel and Streeter 2021) and sentences (Rehavi and Starr 2014) suggests that information *besides* conviction and crime about carceral citizens should have a countervailing humanizing effect (Uggen and Manza 2006).",,,
Theory,15,"There are clear reasons why victimization may generate undeserving perceptions: victimization is highly a salient experience that for many drives negative affect toward those who commit crimes (Ditton et al. 1999). Victims usually engage the criminal legal system because they believe their offender is deserving of punishment, and they are deserving of establishing a sense of safety and justice. Evidence that jurists who have experienced property crime are more likely to see defendents who committed that same crime as culpable and convict too may suggest an ungenerous reading of the CARIN criteria, and reluctance to offer carceral citizenss policy help (Culhane et al 2004).",,,
Theory,16,"However, this logic assumes clear victim-offender boundaries and risks ignoring the broader social context in which violence occurs. And victims have few other options than engaging with the criminal legal system – including if they know their perpetrator personally or understand their perpetrator to be in need of help. And such overlap in contact is significant (Gebo 2019). Victims of violent crime are disproportionately part of communities most heavily policed and incarcerated, and most victims of violent crime know their offender (Bureau of Justice 2024). An extensive literature shows that people who are incarcerated have disproportionately been victims of crime – one review article cited 31 of 37 papers support this overlap (Jennings et al 2012). While 2% of the general US population report being victims of violent crime, up to 45% of carceral citizens have experienced pre-incarceration physical abuse, and 8.5 to 39.2% of specifically sexual abuse (Azimi et al 2019, Carlson and Shafer 2010, Messina et al 2007, Wolff and Shi 2012, Yoder et al. 2017). Still more experience violence while incarcerated (Wolff et al 2009). Thus, while for many victims the proximity and salience of a criminal may bolster negative social constructions and deservingness perceptions, it might also translate to more nuanced perceptions of culpability and a closer alignment of identity that moderates negative affect.",,,
Theory,17,"Moreover, victims face restrictive, ""sticky"" social constructions – what Lens et al (2014) note generate negative feedbacks. While navigating narrow expectations of ""appropriate"" emotional responses in the criminal justice process – non-emotional victims risk disbelief while overly emotional victims face judgment – victims experience ""secondary victimizations"" that foment institutional distrust.",,,
Theory,18,"In this way, victims may come to share with incarcerated individuals not only carceral exposure, but also skepticism toward the system itself and its moral judgments about who is or isn’t deserving (Walker 2020; Anoll & Israel-Trummel 2019). For some, this may produce more nuanced assessments of incarcerated people as victims of systemic injustice rather than mere perpetrators. For others, especially those who strongly identify with retributive justice or lack personal connection to offenders, deservingness perceptions may remain harsher. I therefore expect that:",,,
Theory,19,"**(H1C)** *Victims of violent crime may vary more than other impacted groups in their perceptions of incarcerated people’s deservingness, but on average, will still express more generous views than individuals with no direct or proximate contact with the carceral system.*",,,
Theory,20,#### (H2) *Contact on Policy Preferences*,,,
Theory,21,"Social construction theory suggests that perceptions of target deservingness translate directly to policy preferences: groups constructed as undeserving receive punitive policy while deserving groups receive beneficial policy (Schneider and Ingram 1993). Applied to the carceral domain, this means that warmer perceptions of incarcerated people's deservingness predict greater support for policies that help rather than punish them. Thus, deservingness acts as a mediating bridge between group perception and carceral policy support. I therefore hypothesize that:",,,
Theory,22,**(H2)** more generous perceptions of carceral citizens' deservingness will predict greater support for assistance-oriented policies and reduced support for punitive policies.,,,
Theory,23,"However, evidence from SoRelle and Laws (2023) and others suggests the relationship between deservingness perceptions and policy support may not be straightforward in all contexts. The criminal legal domain may have unique dynamics where perceptions of groups and support for policies directed at them operate through different mechanisms.",,,
Theory,24,"While direct and proximal contact likely increase perceptions of deservingness (H1), there are reasons to expect additional direct effects on policy preferences.",,,
Theory,25,#### Direct and Proximal Contact Effects on Policy Preferences,,,
Theory,26,"Policy feedback literature indicates that contact with the criminal legal system shapes not only perceptions of targets but also attitudes toward institutions and policies. Lerman and Weaver (2014) demonstrate that court, police, and prison encounters foster government distrust and altered civic identity. Walker (2020) shows how carceral citizens develop a sense of ""systemic injustice"" that shapes their policy views beyond simple in-group solidarity.",,,
Theory,27,"Similarly, proximal contact generates institutional feedback effects that may directly influence policy preferences. Anoll and Israel-Trummel (2019) find that neighborhood exposure to discriminatory policing generates perceptions of institutional illegitimacy that shape policy attitudes independent of perceptions about policed individuals.",,,
Theory,28,"These findings suggest that carceral contact may affect policy preferences through mechanisms beyond deservingness perceptions alone. I therefore hypothesize that **(H4)** direct and proximate experiences with incarceration will lead to greater support for decarceral or assistance-oriented policies, even after controlling for deservingness perceptions.",,,
Theory,29,#### Victimization and Policy Preferences,,,
Theory,30,"Similar complexity characterizes the relationship between victimization and policy preferences. While victims are often portrayed in public discourse as supporting punitive policies (Levine and Russell), research indicates victimization does not increase punitiveness (Kleck and Jackson 2016). Instead, victims appear more concerned with improved compensation (Shapland 1984) and addressing root causes of crime (ASJ 2024)",,,
Theory,31,"The experiences of ""expectancy violation"" and secondary victimization documented by Lens et al. (2014) suggest victims may develop institutional skepticism that directly shapes their policy views beyond their perceptions of perpetrators. Victims who experience the criminal justice system as imposing restrictive narratives may develop policy preferences focused on systemic reform rather than individual punishment.",,,
Theory,32,"Evidence that victimization increases political participation (Bateson 2012), including in resource-intensive community organizing, further suggests victims develop nuanced policy perspectives that may not align with simple punitive impulses. Therefore, I extend H4 to include victims, suggesting victimization experience will also predict greater support for assistance-oriented policies beyond what is explained by deservingness perceptions.",,,
Theory,33,#### (H3) Contact and Policy Support Beyond Deservingness,,,
Theory,34,"While deservingness perceptions are expected to mediate the relationship between criminal legal contact and policy attitudes, they may not account for all the ways in which experience with the system shapes public opinion. Policy feedback literature suggests that individuals develop political preferences not only based on how they perceive others, but also based on how they interpret their own treatment by the state. Experiences of incarceration, witnessing loved ones incarcerated, or navigating violence and procedural injustice may generate institutional distrust, civic alienation, or a sense of “systemic injustice” (Walker 2020; Lerman and Weaver 2014). These experiences may shape support for carceral policies independently of how deserving someone believes the targets are. Therefore, this hypothesis helps adjudicate between two possibilities: (1) contact affects policy views only through changes in perceived deservingness (a mediated relationship), or (2) contact exerts an independent effect on policy support—via identity, self-interest, or feedbacks about institutional legitimacy. I therefore hypothesize:",,,
Theory,35,"**H3.** Direct and proximate experiences with incarceration and victimization will predict greater support for assistance-oriented or decarceral policies, even after accounting for perceived deservingness of incarcerated people.",,,
Theory,36,#### Summary,,,
Theory,37,"This theoretical framework recognizes multiple pathways through which carceral contact may shape both deservingness perceptions and policy preferences. While the deservingness literature suggests a straightforward relationship (deservingness → policy preferences), policy feedback literature indicates contact creates institutional effects that may independently influence policy views. By examining both pathways simultaneously, this study contributes to our understanding of how direct experience with policy shapes political attitudes and preferences.",,,
