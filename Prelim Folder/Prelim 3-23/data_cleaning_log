282**Data Cleaning Log for Qualtrics Survey Data**

**Project:** Political Science PhD Paper  
**Data Source:** Qualtrics survey export  
**Data Format:** CSV (from zipped export file)

---

### 1. Export Settings Used (Qualtrics)
- Export **values** (numeric codes), not labels
- ✅ Compress data as .zip file
- ❌ Did not use commas for decimals (use periods instead)
- ✅ Remove line breaks
- ✅ Recode seen but unanswered questions as **-99**
- ✅ Recode seen but unanswered multi-value fields as **0**
- ✅ Export viewing order data for randomized surveys
- ✅ Split multi-value fields into columns
- ❌ Did not use internal IDs in header
- ✅ Exclude survey response edits
- ✅ Include download links for user-uploaded files — **not selected** (not applicable)

### 2. Cleaning Steps

#### A. Unzip and load CSV into R

-loaded "scotg_results.csv" as a tibble using readr tidyverse packagge, stored as "raw_data" 
- returned actual col names instead of #s
- used clean_names() from janitor package to convert col names to format:
  - lowercase
  - spaces and punctuation replaced with underscores
  - ensured names are valied R var names
- 

___

#### B. Power block

created new variable ("block") to label participants as in block A, B, C
went through and c

saved version with labels but otherwise unmodified as "labeled_raw_data.csv". var is in raw_data_cleaned too.

#### C. Drop unneeded columns
| Variable Name     | Description                    | Kept? | Notes                                         |
|------------------|--------------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `StartDate`, `EndDate` | Survey timing info       | ❌ No  | Dropped: metadata                            |
| `IPAddress`            | IP address of respondent | ❌ No  | Dropped: privacy concern                     |
| `RecipientLastName`, etc.| Email/contact metadata | ❌ No  | Dropped: irrelevant + sensitive              |
                |
| `*_DO`                   | Display order metadata | ❌ No  | Dropped after use in block assignment        |
| `Consent:`               | Consent question      | ❌ No  | Used to filter, then dropped                 |
| `Duration (in seconds)`  | Time to complete survey | ✅ Yes | Used for speed check filtering               |
| `block`                  | A/B/C random assignment| ✅ added | Created from _DO columns     

** Recoded `-99` to `NA`
```r
data[data == -99] <- NA
```

#### D. 

#### #. Handled multi-select questions
- These should now be split into columns (e.g., `Q12_1`, `Q12_2`, ...)
- Coded as: `1 = selected`, `0 = not selected`, `NA = not shown`
- Consider using `dplyr::rename()` to make them readable


#### E. Set column types as needed
```r
library(dplyr)
cols_to_factor <- c("gender", "race", "party")
data <- data %>% mutate(across(all_of(cols_to_factor), as.factor))
```


#### F. Save labeled or cleaned versions
```r
write_csv(raw_data, "data/cleaned/labeled_raw_data.csv")  # after adding block
write_csv(raw_data_cleaned, "data/cleaned/cleaned_data.csv")  # final cleaned data
```

### 3. Cleaning Checks Applied

#### ✅ Duration Filtering
- `Duration (in seconds)` distribution reviewed
- Dropped participants who completed in under **8 minutes (480 sec)**

#### ✅ Consent Filtering
- Dropped participants who selected `2` (Did not consent)
- Dropped `Consent:` column after filtering

#### ✅ Attention Checks
- Created pass flags:
  - `attn_q9_pass` → `Q9 == 4`
  - `attn_q17_pass` → matches "purple" (case-insensitive, typo-tolerant)
  - `attn_q1114_pass` → selected "Not at all" for fake platform (code `6`)
    - `-99` → treated as fail
    - `NA` → treated as pass (not shown)
- Dropped participants who failed **all** three checks

#### ✅ Notes for Future Cleaning (TBD)
- `Finished`: check for cases where participants broke off
- Skipped questions: flag high-missingness responses
- Satisficing: investigate fast completion + straightlining
- Implausible combinations (e.g., contradictory demographics)

### 4. Codebook Note (Q4 Matrix)
See section above for cleaned variable structure for Q4 responses.

### #. Q4 Experiences: Incarceration, Victimization

**While I do want to know how people who have only had one of the relevant 
experiences differ from one another, people who have had multiple experience 
still count in each relevant experience group.**

For Example, I want to be able to say the following kinds of statements: 

"People who have been victimized tend to do X more often than people who are not impacted."

"People who been victimized but report having no connection to incarcerated 
people, or having been incarcerated themselves, Y."





---

### 5. Next Steps
- Add `attention_score` column (optional)
- Review distribution of skipped answers
- Flag/remove straightlining or high item-nonresponse
- Recode demographics and composite indexes
