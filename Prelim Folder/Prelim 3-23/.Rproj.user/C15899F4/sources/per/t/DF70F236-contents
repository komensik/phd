#### ***(H3) Contact on Deservingness-Policy Mediation***

While deservingness perceptions may be expected to mediate the relationship between policy experience and beliefs, they may not account for all the ways in which experience with the system shapes public opinion, particular in their application to the criminal legal domain. First, Schneider and Ingram (2019) find that even “deviant” groups (carceral citizens) can become the beneficiaries of policy change, challenging earlier assumptions about the immovability of negative constructions – or suggesting that perceptions of overall target deservingness may not universally predict policy views. Second, differences in the interpretation of CARIN criteria could equally reflect assessments that, for impacted people, are grounded more clearly in ideas about conditions and consequences of confinement. This may be particularly the case given the wide the informational gap between how people who have been incarcerated or support loved ones who are incarcerated, and those for whom a prison is an abstraction (Lee and Comfort 2014). More broadly, however, deservingness literature was established around questions of how people think about welfare provision, and recent work suggests a predictive power of deservingness may dimnish in other domains (SoRelle and Laws 2023).

Further, aforementioned policy feedback literature does not test whether altered conceptions of deservingness translate to mobilization in the face of undeserving policy messages – such perceptions of "systemic injustice" (Walker 2020), "surrogate mobilization" (Anoll 2022), and instititutional illegitimacy (Anoll et al. 2019) and state illigitimacy (Harris 2025) could equally reflect a disjuncture between how generally deserving a group understands themselves to be considered in society, and what policy is fair.

In short, contact with the carceral system may shape policy views through multiple channels: deservingness is one, but not necessarily the only or dominant one. This hypothesis therefore adjudicates between two theoretical possibilities: (1) contact affects policy views *only* via changes in deservingness (a mediated effect), or (2) contact also exerts independent effects through broader lessons about institutions, identity, or justice.

**H3.** Direct and proximate experiences with incarceration and victimization will predict greater support for assistance-oriented or decarceral policies, even after accounting for perceived deservingness of incarcerated people.

These findings suggest that carceral contact may affect policy preferences through mechanisms beyond deservingness perceptions alone. I therefore hypothesize that **(H4)** direct and proximate experiences with incarceration will lead to greater support for decarceral or assistance-oriented policies, even after controlling for deservingness perceptions.

#### Victimization and Policy Preferences

Political narratives invoke victims as proponents of strictly punitive policies and carceral expansion and maintain the assumption their interests align with retribution. Evidence suggest the relationship between victimization and policy preferences is more complicated. First and most straightforwardly, research indicates victimization neither increases punitiveness (Kleck and Jackson 2016) nor drives support for punitive policy. \[\^3\]. Instead, victims appear more concerned with improved compensation (Shapland 1984) and may prioritize social investments in addressing root causes of crime, such as poverty and community disinvestment, over punishment (ASJ 2024).

What's more, experiences of "expectancy violation" and secondary victimization documented by Lens et al. (2014) suggest victims may develop institutional skepticism that directly shapes their policy views beyond their perceptions of perpetrators. Victims who experience the criminal justice system as imposing restrictive narratives may develop policy preferences focused on systemic reform rather than individual punishment. Further still, evidence that victimization increases political participation (Bateson 2012), including in resource-intensive community organizing, further suggests victims develop nuanced policy perspectives that may not align with simple punitive impulses – or decouple target deservingness from ideas about good policy. Therefore, I extend H4 to include victims, suggesting victimization experience will also predict greater support for assistance-oriented policies beyond what is explained by deservingness perceptions.

#### (H3) Contact and Policy Support Beyond Deservingness

This theoretical framework recognizes multiple pathways through which carceral contact may shape both deservingness perceptions and policy preferences. While the deservingness literature suggests a straightforward relationship between deservingness and policy preferences, policy feedback literature indicates contact creates institutional effects that may independently influence policy views. By examining both pathways simultaneously, this study contributes to our understanding of how direct experience with policy shapes political attitudes and preferences.

FOOTNOTES\

\[\^1\]: Schneider and Ingram's theory of social construction goes on to note that policymakers respond not only to their constituencies' perceptions of target deservingness, but also to the political power of target groups, or their ability to ability to access, reward, and/or retaliate against policymakers. These interacting dimensions (power and deservingness) produce four categories of groups in society, to whom policy makers respond with distinct policy. Policymakers are incentivized to help groups who are “advantaged” – both powerful and perceived as deserving -- and “contender” groups, or those who are powerful but constructed as undeserving.  In contrast, policymakers offer burdensome policy to “dependents” – those who are seen as deserving but who are not politically powerful, and punish “deviants,” who are seen as neither deserving nor powerful.  Political representatives’ policy design is also driven by “anticipatory” feedback: policymakers respond to both their perception of groups’ political power and social constructions in terms of electoral consequences – for example, by providing “hidden” benefits to contenders, who are constructed as undeserving but powerful, policymakers can avoid political blowback for helping an “undeserving” group while strengthen their own political position. (Schneider and Ingram 2019, Ellis and Faricy 2020).

\[\^RK\]: The impulse to self-differentiate may motivate individuals who experience arrest alone to maintain distinct narratives — given that contact with policies that convey 'undeserving' messages can motivate beneficiaries to differentiate themselves and their networks from other beneficiaries, for whom they maintain negative social constructions (Soss 2005), and neighborhood inequality motivates a belief in meritocracy for affluent individuals (Newman et al 2014).

\[\^3\]: In the criminal legal domain, these representations are often shaped by racialized media portrayals and political discourse that emphasize danger and individual blame (Lopez 2015; Vasiljevic and Viki 2014).

\[\^4\]: For example, contact may lead individuals to see incarcerated people as facing substantial hardships (*need*), with less control over the conditions that led to incarceration (*control*), and as capable of gratitude, growth, or giving back (*reciprocity*, *attitude*). In contrast to dominant constructions that depict incarcerated people as undeserving, contact may “fill in” these criteria with lived or vicarious knowledge. On this dimension, then, contact may generate warmer deservingness perceptions by replacing stereotypes with personalized, alternative narratives about who carceral citizens are and what their conditions and the consequences of confinement.

\[\^5\] Soss (1999) explains a tendancy of recipients of means-tested welfare (AFDC) to maintain negative constructions about beneficiaries of the same policy (unlike recipients of the non-means tested disability benefits) as a product of political learning while on the AFDC: benefits are burdensome to access, involve stringent behavioral monitoring, and involve more caseworker discretion than standardized rules, conveying to AFDC beneficiaries that government views them as responsible for their need and untrustworthy. This leads beneficiaries to not only internalize a more "undeserving" perception of their own beneficiary group, but also splinters any sense of group solidarity and disaggregates policy views from perceptions of beneficiary deservingness.

\[\^6\]: An extensive literature shows that people who are incarcerated have disproportionately been victims of crime – one review article cited 31 of 37 papers support this overlap (Jennings et al 2012). While 2% of the general US population report being victims of violent crime, up to 45% of carceral citizens have experienced pre-incarceration physical abuse, and 8.5 to 39.2% of specifically sexual abuse (Azimi et al 2019, Carlson and Shafer 2010, Messina et al 2007, Wolff and Shi 2012, Yoder et al. 2017). Still more experience violence while incarcerated (Wolff et al 2009).

\[\^3\] Fresh (2024) finds that the rise of punitive attitudes in the late twentieth century was not simply a response to crime rates or victimization, but was structured by racialized political appeals that mobilized white voters, particularly in the South. Together, these findings suggest that victims may hold complex policy views and may diverge in reality from narratives used to justify their punishment-oriented representation.

\[\^10\] This literature also variations by policy type vis-a-vis hidden or visible policy, 1st and second order effects, and non-effects (Mettler 2011, Soss and Schram 2007, SoRelle 202).

\[\^6\]: One notable exception is Levine and Russell (2023), who show how the design and financing of victim compensation law constructs victims as morally deserving and politically worthy, helping expand state responsibility. Yet even here, the analysis centers on state building and symbolic policy meaning—rather than how victimization itself may function as a form of lived experience that may alter how individuals perceive the state, it's targets, and what policies they deserve.s

\[\^7\] The survey expands on Kreiter and Smith (2018)'s approach by recruiting from a Bovitz proprietary panel and reducing the number of groups individuals access to reduce issues of respondent fatigue. 2,716 eligible participants were recruited to complete the 30-minute survey on the platform Forthright, and were paid 10 dollars. The sample is just under 51% women and 49% men, and leans more Democratic than the national average (39% versus 31%) but is equally Republican (25%). The underrepresentation of Republicans may have a minimizing effect. I apply exclusion restrictions for low response quality, failing to pass all three attention checks, and extreme outlier responses, and also create two response quality variables for robustness checks, resulting in a final sample of \[2,286\]. Sample details are in Table 1 of the appendix.

\[8\] I expect that respondents under report both victimization and incarceration because they are stigmatized experience, introducing random noise (Skogan 1986).

\[\^7\] Survey participants were randomly assorded into three sections (A, B, and C). All respondents saw the same 45 groups. Each section then reviewed an additional (20) unique groups.

\[\^6\] Research consistently shows that political conservativism is associated with stronger support for punitive policy, and also stronger and more frequent support for guilty verdicts and harsher sentencing recommendations as well as harsher prison conditions (Green 2012, Pyo 2024, Hansen and Navarro 2024). These may refllect beliefs in personal culpability, expressive retributive justifications for punishment, and value commitments to law and order that are often fundamental to conservative ideology (Burton et al 2020, Mancici et al 2021, Wilson et al 2015).

\[\^7\] To reduce potential ordering effects and context bias, the survey randomized the presentation of (1) deservingness target groups, (2) the order of major survey sections, and (3) the assignment of additional deservingness targets beyond a shared core set. Specifically, all respondents rated a common set of groups—including "incarcerated people," "criminals," and "incarcerated women"—while a subset of respondents were randomized into seeing additional groups such as "incarcerated parents," "sex offenders," or "formerly incarcerated individuals." Respondents also completed survey modules in varied order (e.g., deservingness, policy preferences, and ideology), and the ordering of target groups within the deservingness battery was fully randomized.

To assess whether results are sensitive to these randomized elements, I conducted a series of robustness checks. First, I tested whether the *position* of a group within the list influenced its average rating. Regressing deservingness scores on group order (with respondent-level controls) revealed no significant trends, suggesting minimal fatigue or anchoring effects. Second, I examined whether the order of survey modules affected the relationship between key predictors (e.g., deservingness or ideology) and outcomes. These models revealed no systematic variation in effect sizes or significance based on presentation order. Finally, I re-estimated core models separately within each randomized assignment block (e.g., those who rated "sex offenders" vs. "incarcerated parents"). Results were substantively consistent across groups, indicating that exposure to additional deservingness targets did not meaningfully alter the relationship between perceptions of incarcerated people and policy attitudes.

Taken together, these checks help determine whether findings are robust to random variation in the presentation and structure of the survey. Full regression tables for all robustness checks are available in the appendix (Tables A#–A#).
