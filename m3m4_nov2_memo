Summary of M3/M4 and Nov 2nd Analyses

Session Summary: Nov 2 — Policy Models (M3–M5)
Purpose

We analyzed how perceptions of incarcerated people’s deservingness and contact with the criminal legal system relate to support for carceral policy outcomes.
Models 3–5 build directly on Hypothesis 2 (H2): more generous perceptions of carceral citizens’ deservingness predict greater support for help-oriented policies and lower support for punitive ones.

✅ Models Covered
M3: Help-policy model (prisonhelp)
lm(prisonhelp ~ d_incppl_pris_abc + impact +
    Republican + Democrat + fiscal_ideology + social_ideology +
    penalpoint + desor_core + fire_rare + fire_privilege +
    fire_angry + fire_fear + gender + Black + Hispanic + OtherRace,
    data = raw_data_cleaned)


Findings

d_incppl_pris_abc → positive, significant (b = 0.004, p < .001).
A 10-point increase in deservingness ≈ 0.04-point increase on the 1–5 help-support scale.

impact → small, n.s.

Partisanship (Rep/Dem) → lower support vs. Independents.

penalpoint → negative, highly significant.

desor_core → slightly negative, n.s.

Adj R² ≈ 0.13.

Diagnostics

VIFs all < 5 → no multicollinearity.

Cook’s D → no major outliers.

Semi-partial R²: d_incppl_pris_abc ≈ 0.02 (largest unique share).

Δ Adj R² when adding desor_core ≈ +0.005 → negligible.

Correlations show desor_core and d_incppl_pris_abc r = 0.55, confirming overlap.
Residualized desor_core → r ≈ 0.07 with prisonhelp → redundancy, not suppression.

M4: Punitive-policy model (prisonpen)

Same specification as M3.

Findings

d_incppl_pris_abc → negative, significant (b = –0.005, p < .001).

impact → positive, significant (b ≈ 0.10, p ≈ .02).

Fiscal/social ideology → negative, significant.

penalpoint → negative, p < .001.

FIRE items: fire_privilege and fire_angry reduce punitiveness; fire_fear positive (.05 level).

Adj R² ≈ 0.16.

⚙️ Control Variable: desor_core

Constructed as the mean deservingness rating (0–100) for “help-needing” groups: TANF, SNAP, Medicaid, Medicare, unemployed, poor families, homeless, immigrants, undocumented.
High = more generous orientation.
Reliability: α ≈ 0.91.

Role: included to isolate effects specific to incarcerated-group deservingness.
Empirical result: strongly correlated with d_incppl_pris_abc (r = .55) but adds < 0.1 % unique variance; effect of incarcerated-specific deservingness remains robust.

Interpretation paragraph (already finalized):

To isolate the unique relationship between respondents’ perceptions of incarcerated people and their policy preferences, both models include a control for general deservingness orientation (desor_core) … [paragraph as finalized above].

⚖️ Diagnostic Summary
Test	Result	Takeaway
VIFs	all < 5	No collinearity issue
Cook’s D	none > 4/n	No influential outliers
Semi-partial R²	d_incppl_pris_abc ≈ 0.02 → dominant	Specific deservingness most explanatory
Δ Adj R² (add desor_core)	≈ +0.005	Minimal additional fit
Correlations	desor_core ~ d_incppl_pris_abc = 0.55; both ~ ideology ≈ –0.35	Shared attitudinal base
Residual check	Residualized desor_core r ≈ 0.07 with prisonhelp	Redundancy, not suppression
🧩 Model 5: Interaction (Deservingness × Impact)
m5 <- lm(prisonhelp ~ d_incppl_pris_abc * impact +
          Republican + Democrat + fiscal_ideology + social_ideology +
          penalpoint + desor_core + fire_rare + fire_privilege +
          fire_angry + fire_fear + gender + Black + Hispanic + OtherRace,
          data = raw_data_cleaned)


Model logic

Tests whether the effect of deservingness on policy support differs by contact (impact).

Interaction term d_incppl_pris_abc:impact → not significant (p ≈ 0.40 no-controls; p ≈ 0.76 with controls).

Interpretation: the positive effect of deservingness on help-policy support is statistically similar across contact groups.

🪜 Model Progression Overview
Model	Focus	Role in framework
M3 & M4	Main effects	Baseline test of H2 (deservingness → policy)
M5 & M6	Interaction (Deservingness × Contact)	Tests moderation — does contact condition the effect?
M7 & M8	Mediation	Tests indirect path Contact → Deservingness → Policy
M9 & M10	Robustness/consistency	Extends to general help orientation & response variance
🧾 Nov 2 To-Do List (for continuation)

Re-run M5–M6 analyses with centered deservingness (mean-center to improve interpretability).

Plot interactions (interactions::interact_plot).

Compute simple slopes (marginaleffects::slopes) for each contact group.

Confirm coding of impact, desor_core, penalpoint (direction & scaling).

Run mediation models (M7–M8) once M5–M6 are finalized.

Optional robustness:

Drop one of the ideology measures (high r = 0.87).

Weighted models or block-restricted subsets.

Draft transition text: “While M3–M4 establish the baseline relationship … M5–M6 test whether this relationship varies by contact experience …”

💡 Key Takeaway for Future You / New Session

d_incppl_pris_abc = main attitudinal driver of both help and punishment policy preferences.

desor_core serves as a conceptual control, not an explanatory factor.

Contact (impact) has negligible direct effects, no moderating effect yet, and will next be examined as a mediator.

Diagnostics confirm model stability, appropriate scaling, and no multicollinearity.
