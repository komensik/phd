## Purpose

This memo documents the analytic logic behind tests used to evaluate how distinct forms of contact with the criminal legal system—**incarceration experience (`incarc`)**, **knowing someone incarcerated (`impact`)**, and **victimization (`vict`)**—relate to attitudes toward carceral citizens (`d_incppl_pris_abc`).\
Models account for ideology, punitiveness, race, and a control for generalized deservingness attitudes (`desor_core`).

Each diagnostic test clarifies a different feature of model fit, explanatory power, or robustness.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Base and Full Regression Models

\`\`\`r lm(d_incppl_pris_abc \~ incarc + controls, data = raw_data_cleaned) coeftest(model, vcov = vcovHC(model, type = "HC1")) Purpose: Estimate the association between experiential exposure and policy attitudes, adjusting for covariates. Why: Baseline coefficients quantify direction and magnitude; robust SEs confirm inference stability under heteroskedasticity.

2.  Univariate Explanatory Power r Copy code lm(d_incppl_pris_abc \~ each_variable) Purpose: Evaluate how much outcome variance each variable explains alone. Metrics: Adjusted R² (fit adjusted for model size) and AIC (model parsimony). Why: Identifies the most powerful standalone predictors. Finding: desor_core explains ≈ 30% of variance; experiential variables \< 1%.

3.  Incremental Δ Adjusted R² Tests r Copy code base \<- lm(d_incppl_pris_abc \~ incarc) expanded \<- lm(d_incppl_pris_abc \~ incarc + control) ΔR2 \<- summary(expanded)$adj.r.squared - summary(base)$adj.r.squared Purpose: Quantify additional variance explained when each control is added beyond the focal contact variable. Why: Distinguishes variables that materially improve model fit from those that do not. Finding: Adding desor_core raises Adj R² \~ +0.24; other controls negligible.

4.  Semi-Partial R² (Unique Variance) r Copy code library(rsq) rsq.partial(full_model, type = "sp") Purpose: Measure each predictor’s unique contribution within the full model. Why: Shows which variables independently account for outcome variance. Finding: desor_core ≈ 0.23 (23% unique variance); incarc ≈ 0.009; vict ≈ 0.0006—attitudes dominate, contact adds a small independent effect.

5.  Standardized Coefficients r Copy code sd_y \<- sd(outcome) sd_x \<- sapply(model.frame(model)\[-1\], sd, na.rm=TRUE) std_beta \<- coef(model) \* (sd_x / sd_y) Purpose: Put predictors on a common SD scale to compare relative magnitude. Why: Reveals effect size independent of measurement units. Finding: desor_core β ≈ 0.50; incarc β ≈ 0.08; vict β ≈ 0.02—deservingness has the strongest standardized influence.

6.  Robustness & Missingness Models report “( n obs deleted due to missingness )” confirming listwise deletion only.

All summary statistics computed with na.rm = TRUE.

vict has smaller effective n (277 “yes” responses), consistent with survey structure.

Why: Confirms differences in N are expected and not due to coding loss.

7.  Key Interpretive Logic Statistic What It Tests How It Informs Decisions AIC Model fit + parsimony Compare models’ overall adequacy Adjusted R² Total variance explained Gauge overall explanatory power Δ Adj R² Added variance from new control Identify influential covariates Semi-partial R² Unique variance per predictor Quantify independent contribution Standardized β Effect size comparability Rank predictors’ substantive strength Robust SEs Heteroskedasticity check Validate significance robustness Missingness checks Data integrity Verify sample comparability

8.  Core Findings & Modeling Decisions desor_core (general deservingness attitudes) overwhelmingly predicts support for carceral-citizen policies.

incarc shows a small but statistically significant independent effect; vict does not.

Because desor_core strongly correlates with both policy support and contact, it is retained as a control in all models to isolate the independent impact of experiential exposure.

This memo encapsulates the analytic logic so a reviewer or future collaborator (or ChatGPT session) immediately understands why each statistic is used and what inferential role it plays.
