At year end 2001, more than 5.6 million U.S. adults had served time in a state or federal prison (BOP 2003). Many millions more experience incarceration through proximal contact – because they have a family member or friend who is incarcerated, or because they were the victim of a crime prosecuted by the state. This direct and proximal carceral contact has generated a significant scholarship in recent years that attempts to understand how contact with this particular state policy feeds back to shape attitudes towards the state (*cite*), attitudes towards policies (*cite*), and political engagement (*cite*).\n\nImplicit in much of this carceral policy feedback literature is the contention that attitudes and engagement are shaped by perceptions of what the targets of state policy *deserve*. Across numerous policy domains, individuals report being more willing to support policy when the targets of that policy are viewed as deserving (cite). Yet, there is limited evidence on how carceral contact, specifically, shapes perceptions of deservingness and the extent to which these perceptions drive policy views. Further still (victimization).\n\nThis paper addresses these X gaps. To do so, I ask how direct and proximate experiences of incarceration and victimization shape perceptions of the deservingness of incarcerated people, and whether these perceptions translate to opinions on prison policy. Employing and connecting both deservingnness and policy feedback frameworks, I theorize that as carceral contact can drive perceptions of carceral state *il*legitimacy and distrust, it may too engender warmer perceptions of carceral targets. Further still, direct and proximal contact in the form of both incarceration and victimization may allow for more nuanced perceptions of who carceral targets are and what policy help they, or the interest of public justice and safety, need – irregardless of carceral targets perceived deserving status. In otherwords, the relationship between target deservingness and policy views may look different than in others, and across contact groups. I test these relationships using newly collected 2024 data on perceptions of target group deservingness, policy experiences, and policy preferences across the states.\n\nIn doing so, I contribute to literature on social constructions and deservingness, in which scholars are exploring the extent to which theories rooted in welfare provision apply to other domains, testing the extent to which deservingness perceptions mediate policy opinions, and, interleaved with policy feedback literature, whether those who are \"closest to the pain\" or have first-hand experience with policy differ from those who do not. I also shed new light on two unexamined components of policy feedback of the carceral state: whether contact shapes views on criminal legal policy, and feedback effects of victimization.\n\nMy theoretical starting point is that perceptions of what groups like carceral citizens deserve are often based on discursive social constructions about them (Schneider and Ingram, 1993). Policy directly shapes these constructions, as it produces both resource and interpretive feedback effects that are part of the discourse that shapes constructions. In forming opinions about policy and deciding what inequalities are tolerable, publics draw on salient social constructions about the relevant policy target and use them in a heuristic process to quickly determine whether a target is “deserving” of help (citation). Theoretically, then these judgements translate to, or at play in the formation of, beliefs about criminal legal policy.\n\nHere, I suggest that this loop between policy design and the messages it transmits about what it’s targets deserve may be interrupted for some citizens due to their connections to those who are justice involved, Emerging evidence that *responses to* the criminal legal system’s policy messages vary, and specifically that some respond to the negative messages transmitted by criminal legal policy with dubiousness towards state legitimacy suggest perceptions of what its targets deserve may vary as well (Walker 2020, Harris 2025).\n\n. . .\n\n# Literature\n\nHow does contact with the criminal legal system affect perceptions of it's targets deserve? And what do these deservingness perceptions mean for policy views? These questions intersect with two literatures. First, scholarship on social constructions and deservingness examine how groups become characterized as deserving or undeserving of government assistance, and theorizes that both policy views and outcomes hinge on such characterizations (Schneider and Ingram 1993, Smith and Kreitzer 2024, Oorschot 2006). While this literature leaves open the question of how individual experiences with policy might alter characterizations about it's targets, lessons from policy feedback literature suggest they might. This closely related literature shows that policies can shape political attitudes and behavior across domains, including that of the carceral state. While these scholars have established true broad mechanisms through which carceral contact indeed influences political participation and institutional trust – \"resource\" and \"interpretive\" effects – much less is known about how such contact affects attitudes toward the targets of these policies Specifically, we do not yet understand how direct or proximal experience with incarceration or victimization might reshape perceptions of incarcerated people's deservingness and, in turn, opinions on prison policy. I briefly review these literatures here.\n\nIn the wake of Schneider and Ingram's (1993) theory of social constructions, scholars have coalesced around the idea that attitudes towards policy targets are in dialectic with policy. That is, policy design not only has \"interpretive effects\" on its targets but also shapes discourse *about* them. In this way, policy can \"telegraph to the public how target groups should be treated,\" and helps to produce social constructions or \"value-laden components, including stereotypes, dominant ideologies, and assumptions\" about groups (Smith and Kreitzer 2024, PAGE). As consequence, social constructions are contingent. They are contingent, for example, on local, state, and political and cultural contexts and also on the political identity of and ideology held by the 'perceiver' (Smith and Kreitzer 2018). This means both that policy can *reflect* existing social constructions, and that it can feed back to causally affect further social constructions of who targets are. The notion of who targets *are* in turn affects how people perceive what they *should* receive – i.e., what they deserve. These perceptions matter because they are theorized to be understood as policy preferences and translated by policymakers into policy that helps or hinders groups, reinforcing their social constructions (Schneider and ingram 2019).\n\nA related stream of literature explains that people form quick judgements about policy targets' deservingness by evaluating constructions along five dimensions in an evolutionarily-grounded impulse to help \"reciprocators\" and avoid \"free-riders\" (Petersen 2012, Aaroe and Petersen 2014). These \"CARIN\" criteria primarily attend to cues about whether recipients cannot help their circumstances, or whether they are seeking unearned benefits. They refer to: *control,* which in its original conception was closely related to *need*, referring to whether someone is perceived as lazy or unlucky – a consideration Oorschot (2006) argues can override all others. More recently, perception of a group or individual’s *need* for assistance has considered the severity of their neediness and *control,* or the degree to which they are responsible (SoRelle and Laws 2024). Perceptions of the group’s *attitude* refer to whether the beneficiary is grateful and likeable, and closely related perceptions of the group’s *reciprocity* connote their history or apparent willingness to contribute to society. Last, the *identity* characteristic holds that people will evaluate more generously the deservingness of others whose identity is aligned with their own (Oorschot 2000, 2006).\n\nDo experiences with policy change how these constructions and characteristics are interpreted? While the deservingness literature on this is limited, there is some evidence it can. In the context of student debt relief, SoRelle and Laws (2023) find that people who have had student loans themselves view borrowers as more deserving of debt forgiveness – reflecting perceived closeness of \"identity.\" Maltby and Kreitzer (2022) find similar effects in the context of welfare, but that such solidaristic effects of policy experience begin to erode when individuals consider beneficiaries of welfare programs that are *different* than one's own – a finding social constructionists may note reflects the \"stickiness\" of negative constructions of target populations and tendencies to construct more 'deserving' subsets within a population while stigmatizing others (Schneider and Ingram 1990, Matos 2019), or deservingness scholars might explain as a product of shared experience changing what information about a group is implicitly available (Feather 1999, 2009). Recently, however, Schneider and Ingram (2019) have noted more complicated dynamics around negatively constructed – specifically, \"deviant\" – groups and SoRelle and Laws (2023) further note that deservingness perceptions may not linearly translate into support for policy overall.\n\nGiven the criminal legal systems particular \\[high costs and visibiliy\\], scholars note that \"policy contact\" must be understood both in terms of direct contact – arrest, incarceration, fines and fees – and also in terms of proximate contact, or the experiences of the disproportionately Black, Latinx, and low-income social networks and neighborhhoods of the incarcerated (Baumbartner, Epp, and Shoub 2018; Davenport, Soule, and Armstrong 2011, Western et al 2004, Massoglia 2008). A closely related literature on policy feedback offers more insight into this dimension. To better understand how both direct and proximate criminal legal contact may shape perceptions of targets of the system's targets, how contact may shape views on criminal legal policy, and the link between the two, we turn there now.\n\n### Policy Feedback\n\n**Introduce PF: resource, interpretive, direct, proximate**\n\nHow might policy experience shape social constructions, perceptions of target deservingness, and produce policy preferences?\n\nFeedback scholars show that policies have the capacity to shape and reshape subsequent policy landscapes. Such \"feedbacks\" operate through two broad mechanisms. First, policies create resource effects by distributing benefits and imposing costs that alter political capacities and engagement – costs incurred in domains that are not strictly \"political\" have political ramifications. Similarly, \"interpretive\" effects connote the ability of policy design and implementation to convey messages to it's targets about what they can expect and may ask of government as a whole. This interpretive element involves but is distinct from social construction theory, in that it stresses the messages a policy target translates from interacting with policy, rather than the more general messages conveyed about targets from policy. Further, feedback scholarship dilineates between direct and proximate targets of policy.\n\nAM – HERE: think abt what you will need to critique from R+K (policy design). can do a \"in xyz example\" and talk briefly about Soss. Also remember to have distinct section on proximate.\n\n.Findings from Soss's (2005) a study of recipients of means tested versus non-means tested welfare, supports the latter.\n\nundeserving messages and resources effects unique to AFDC design, like stringent behavioral monitoring and caseworker discretion in lieu of standardized rules, lead its recipients to not only  internalize a more “undeserving” perception of AFDC beneficiaries, but do so to the point they seek to differentiate themselves from other beneficiaries and splinter any sense of beneficiary group solidarity – and splintering their welfare policy views from their views of the deservingness of beneficiaries.\n\n**CJ Policy Feedback**\n\nThe criminal legal\n\n# Theory\n\n\n```{mermaid}\n---\nconfig:\n  theme: redux\n---\n\nflowchart LR\n    A{\"Policy Contact\"} -. direct .-> C{\"Policy Preference\"}\n    A --> B{\"Target Deservingness\"}\n    B --> C\n    E[\"Alt. <br> to Contact\"] -.-> A & B\n    F[\"Alt. <br>Mediators\"] -.-> B & C\n    B -.-> F\n     A:::Sky\n     C:::Sky\n     B:::Sky\n   \n    classDef Sky stroke-width:1px, stroke-dasharray:none, stroke:#374D7C, fill:#E2EBFF, color:#374D7C\n\n```\n\n\nHow does being directly or proximally impacted by the criminal legal system shape perceptions of what carceral citizens – incarcerated people, particularly – deserve?\n\nMy theoretical starting point is that perceptions of what groups like carceral citizens deserve are often shaped by social constructions about them (Schneider and Ingram 1993). Like stereotypes, these constructions are produced by policy and discourse – both political, cultural, and popular. On the individual level, then, these constructions are often taken up in a heuristic process to form quick judgements about what a target group deserves. Thus, predominant racialized constructions of incarcerated people – “thugs,” “felons,” or “inmates” – suggesting culpable, ungrateful, “takers” responsible for their condition of confinement are likely interpolated as undeserving, translating to support for punitive carceral policy. \n\nBuilding on a policy feedback literature that shows interactions with the criminal legal system shape political behavior and attitudes towards the state (Anoll et al 2022, Anoll and Israel-Trummel 2019, Walker 2020, Lerman and Weaver 2014), I propose interactions with the criminal legal system also shape attitudes towards *targets* of the state – incarcerated people, what they deserve, and policy.  \n\nWhile some work finds that targets of policy can internalize negative or undeserving constructions (Soss 1999), much of the work on criminal legal contact stresses that demobilization is a product of resource effects or interpretive effects *distinct* from an “undeserving” self-conception (Lerman and Weaver 2014, White 2019). Instead, other work emphasizes that direct contact with the criminal legal system can heighten in-group solidarity (Lerman and Weaver 2014) and mobilize despite resource and interpretive feedbacks that should be demobilizing, specifically when policy targets reject policy “teachings” about their lower civic status as part of a sense of systemic injustice – suggesting a perception that the criminal legal system is less legitimate or authoritative, and of its targets as distinctly deserving (Walker 2020).\n\nProximal contact also generates political mobilization (Anoll et al 2022, White 2019b). Anoll’s (2022) findings that family of the incarcerated vote at higher rates in states with more stringent carceral disenfranchisement policies suggests that “surrogate” mobilization is motivated by a desire to act on behalf a “deserving” incarcerated citizen. Further, from Anoll and Israel-Trummel’s (2019) findings that neighborhood exposure to racially discriminatory policing generate perceptions of institutional *il*legitimacy – distrust in police and government – one might infer that exposure should also alter and perhaps enhance perceptions in institutional targets as well. \n\nCoupled with deservingness scholarship on experience (Sorelle and Laws), I expect that the perceptions of what carceral citizens deserve may look different for people who have themselves been or who know carceral citizens. Specifically, I hypothesize that **(H1) those with direct or proximal contact, or who have close social ties to incarcerated people, will view incarcerated people as more deserving**. While Maltby and Kreitzer (2022) find that proximal contact does *not* impact perceptions of deservingness, there are important limitations in their study that necessitate further examination of direct and proximate impact. First, they report a dependent variable of aggregated deservingness scores for disparate groups – ranging from “prisoners” to “opioid users” to “welfare cheats.” Second, they measure criminal legal contact by asking participants whether they or someone they know has been either arrested or incarcerated. Grouping these distinct experiences together muddies the waters. Arrest and incarceration impact different swaths of the population (CITATION). [\\[KM1\\]](#_msocom_1) Arrest alone is distinct in its distribution of resources and political incentives as incarceration (CITATION). And while short stints in jail can reduce voter participation, individuals who are convicted, sentenced, and incarcerated in prison encounter entirely different policy designs, which “teach” very different “lessons” about one’s civic standing and government responsiveness. Soss (2005) finds that not only do recipients of non-means tested welfare differentiate themselves as more deserving of help than recipients of means-tested healthcare, but that deserving-skeptic messages imbued in policy design (drug testing, a requirement to prove need or exhaust alternative sources of aid) are so pervasive as to motivate beneficiaries to maintain negative social constructions of welfare recipients, from whom they try to differentiate themselves and their networks. Thus, like affluent individuals for whom inequality motivates a belief in meritocracy (Newman et al 2014), individuals who are arrested and not found guilty, or are given alternative “lighter” sentences than incarceration, may differentiate themselves or their networks.\n\nMost obviously, under a judicial system that maintains the presumption of innocence and that leverages sentences based on seriousness, individuals who are arrested and individuals who are incarcerated should send very different messages about targets’ deservingness to mass publics and policymakers.\n\nPlacing carceral contact in the frame of cumulative punishment in the US highlights another layer around which literature on policy feedbacks of the carceral state has under-explored – namely, the overlap of “victims” and “perpetrators” and policy feedbacks resulting from contact with the criminal legal system as a victim of crime. To consider how serious victimization may shape perception of target deservingness and prison policy, I first note the clear and expected consequences of victimization for these matters. Victimization is obviously a salient experience that often generates anger (Ditton et al 1999) and drive negative affect and perceptions of what criminals deserve. Victims of crime, to be sure, usually engage the criminal legal system because they believe their offender is deserving of punishment, and they are deserving of establishing a sense of safety and justice. But it is also true that to accomplish the latter, victims of violent crime have few other options – including if they know their perpetrator personally or understand their perpetrator to be in need of help. Evidence that crime victimization increases political participation (Bateson 2012), including in resource-intensive activities like sustained community organizing may offer pathways for coping with trauma (Rozowsky 2002, Walklate 2007), but may also reflect more nuanced views of policy changes needed to address root causes of crime.\n\nFurther, victims of violent crime are disproportionately part of communities most heavily policed and incarcerated, and most victims of violent crime know their offender (Bureau of Justice 2024). An extensive literature shows that people who are incarcerated have disproportionately been victims of crime – one review article cited 31 of 37 papers support this overlap (Jennings et al 2012). While 2% of the general US population report being victims of violent crime, up to 45% of carceral citizens have experienced pre-incarceration physical abuse, and 8.5 to 39.2% of specifically sexual abuse (Azimi et al 2019, Carlson and Shafer 2010, Messina et al 2007, Wolff and Shi 2012, Yoder et al. 2017). Still more experience violence while incarcerated (Wolff et al 2009).  Thus, while for many victims the proximity and salience of a criminal may bolster negative social constructions and deservingness perceptions, it might also translate to more nuanced perceptions of culpability and a closer alignment of identity that moderates negative affect.\n\nWhile victims are usually presented as supportive of punitive policy in public theater – the recent naming of the Laken Riley Act, offers a clear example – the relationship is far less clear. Instead, victimization does not appear to increase punitiveness (Kleck and Jackson 2016), and victims instead appear more concerned with improved victims compensation (Shapland 1984) and policies addressing “root causes” of crime (ASJ 2024). Further, victims themselves may experience a wide arrange of policy feedbacks, complicating views on policy compared to those without direct experience. Thus, I include victims in H1.\n\nSocial construction theory holds that perceptions of target group deservingness translate to policy: legislators understand how groups are perceived, and produce policy that, in this case, will punish undeserving incarcerated targets. Deservingness scholars expect that perceptions of deservingness translate directly into support policy opinion, too. However, findings from Sorelle and Laws () and legislative responsiveness literature () suggest neither relationship may be as straightforward – further still, literature in the criminal legal domain has not assessed this relationship directly. In the criminal legal domain, I expect that the salience of negative social constructions of policy targets could make perceptions of deservingness “stickier” than views on what policy help or punishment targets deserve. Thus, while I expect that individuals who are directly or proximately impacted by the criminal legal system will hold different beliefs about criminal policy than those who are not, the role of deservingness perceptions in this context remains to be seen.\n\nTo summarize:\n\nH1: People who are directly or proximally impacted by the criminal legal system will see incarcerated people as more deserving than people who do not.\n\n1B: Among those who xyz,\n\nH2:  People who are directly or proximally impacted by the criminal legal system will hold different beliefs about criminal legal policy [than those who are not]{.underline}. \n\n\\*Relationship between deservingness and policy preferences may look different for those who are impacted than those who are not impacted.\n\n [\\[KM1\\]](#_msoanchor_1)Move to methods? Or, because their findings contradict the H, I thought I should still address somewhat here?\n\n. . .\n\n# Data and Methods\n\n**Analysis**\n\nI test these hypotheses using a nationally-representative survey that asks about participants’ direct and proximal experience with incarceration or victimization of violent crime, perceptions of deservingness, and views on policy. In this section, I describe these data and methods for analyses.\n\n**Data**\n\n*Survey*\n\nI explore the application of deservingness to carceral contexts using novel survey data collected in September 2024 by Smith, Bowman, and Mensik.  Kreitzer and Smith, previously empirically mapped constructions of power and deservingness of 87 target populations by employing MTurk workers; this new data set mimics the strengths of that data collection strategy, and makes important changes, such as relying on survey respondents recruited from Bovitz proprietary panel and reducing the number of groups individuals assess, to address issues of respondent fatigue.\n\nThis survey targets the US adult general population. 2,716 participants were on recruited to complete surveys on the platform Forthright. To be eligible for the study, participants were required to provide informed consent, be at least 18 years old, and be residents of the US. They were paid \\$10 for completing the 30-minute survey. The sample is just under 51% women, and 49% men. The sample is more Democratic than the national average (39% versus 31%), but as Republican (25%). I apply exclusions for low response quality failing to pass two attention checks, satisficing, and extreme outlier response times[\\[KM1\\]](#_msocom_1) .\n\n*Measuring Deservingness*\n\nMy first key variable of interest is perceptions of target group deservingness. These perceptions are measured as in Kreitzer and Smith (2018) . Participants are asked to consider a definitional deservingness prompt, and indicate their perception of group deservingness using a 0-100 slider scale set to 50. Participants rate the deseringness of a total of 65 groups, including “incarcerated people/prisoners.”\n\nI standardize deservingness by taking difference between the score a respondent gives to a given group and the average score the respondent gave across all groups. I also normalize deservingness scores by calculating mean deservingness scores of incarcerated people for all respondents and subtract each respondent's individual rating of incarcerated people from this mean to report whether incarcerated deservingness ratings are above or below average.\n\nAs I describe in the theory section, I expect that experiencing incarceration, or having close ties with someone who has, and experiences of victimization affect perceptions of target deservingness and policy preferences. To measure contact and proximate contact, I ask respondents whether they or someone they know well have been \"incarcerated in jail or prison,\" and/or whether they \"been a victim of violent crime.\" I operationalize these measures using three separate dummy variables.\n\nI include variables to control for alternative explanations for both how policy exposure might impact perceptions of target deservingness.\n\nPerceptions of an incarcerated person's deservingness may reflect broader attitudes towards policy targets who are implicitly constructed as needy and or deviant. *This may be particularly true in this experiment design, where participants are given definitions of deserving (groups \"contributing to the general welfare of society and worthy, and thus...deserving of sympathy, pity, or help \\[and\\] ...good, smart, hardworking, loyal, disciplined, generous, caring of others, respectful, and creative\") and undeserving (\"burden to the general welfare of society, and believed to be undeserving of sympathy, pity, or help,\" and described as \"greedy, disrespectful, disloyal, immoral, disgusting, dangerous, lazy, and expect\\[ing\\] others to care for them.\"*). To control for this general tendency, I compile deservingness scores of groups who fit these frames, such as different welfare recipients, Medicaid and Medicare/SSN recipients, the unemployed, poor families, homeless individuals, and asylum seekers/refugees.\n\n... these perceptions could reasonably reflect negative attitudes towards and beliefs about people who are presumed to commit crimes. \"Punitiveness,\" broadly conceived as tendencies to explain crime through the lens of individual culpability and moral failing, and prioritize retributive justice in policy responses to crime, may definitially prescribe perceptions that people who are incarcerated are *undeserving*.\n\n-   note about conditions\n\nanchor support for punitive (rather than rehabilitative) policy in a retributive framework\n\nIn the US, the \"punitive impulse\" or tendency to explain crime through the lens of individual culpability and support retributive justice is\n\nPublic opinion and criminological literature dealing with attitudes towards criminal legal policy usually, and rightly, control for punitiveness.
