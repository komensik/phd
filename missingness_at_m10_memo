Note on Missingness Analysis
Key Findings
Our missingness analysis reveals several important patterns relevant to the variance analysis:
1. Independence from Treatment Variables
Chi-squared tests indicate that having fewer than 4 valid responses appears independent of all impact-related variables:

Overall impact: χ² = 2.65, p = 0.103
Incarceration: χ² = 0.003, p = 0.956
Victimization: χ² = 0.939, p = 0.333
Know someone incarcerated: χ² = 2.471, p = 0.116

None reach conventional significance, suggesting missingness is not systematically related to treatment status. The "know incarcerated" variable shows the weakest independence (p = 0.116), warranting attention in subgroup analyses.
2. Systematic Pattern in Item-Level Missingness
The missingness patterns reveal a clear structure rather than random dropout:

76-78% complete all 6 items (pattern "000000")
13-15% skip only the last question (pattern "000001")
7-10% skip all questions (pattern "111111")
<0.1% skip the last 4 questions (pattern "001111")
Other partial patterns are essentially absent

This suggests two primary mechanisms:

Survey fatigue: The last question has disproportionate missingness (~15% skip only this item)
Complete non-response: A subset (~8-10%) doesn't engage with this battery at all

3. Consistency Across Subgroups
The missingness patterns are remarkably stable across impact subcategories, with the "last question only" pattern ranging narrowly from 13.8% to 15.1% across all groups.
Implications for Current Analysis
For the immediate variance analysis, you can likely proceed with dropping respondents with <4 valid items because:

Statistical tests support independence of missingness from treatment
You're only losing ~8.4% of the sample (187/2222)
The patterns suggest these are mostly complete non-responders rather than selective item skipping

However, consider running sensitivity analyses comparing results with and without these cases.
Recommendations for Subgroup Analyses
When examining differences across impact subcategories (incarc/vict/knowincarc), implement the following:
1. Enhanced Monitoring

Track missingness rates by subgroup in all analyses
Note that "know incarcerated" showed marginal association (p = 0.116) with missingness

2. Item-Specific Attention

Consider analyzing the last question separately given its unique missingness pattern
Test whether dropping this item affects your composite's psychometric properties
Examine if the last question's content differs meaningfully (e.g., more sensitive, complex, or redundant)

3. Robustness Checks

Primary analysis: Use ≥4 valid responses criterion
Sensitivity analysis 1: Require all 6 responses
Sensitivity analysis 2: Use ≥3 valid responses
Sensitivity analysis 3: Drop the problematic last item entirely and use 5-item composite

4. Reporting Strategy
Document that:

Missingness shows a systematic pattern (primarily last-item dropout and complete non-response)
Tests found no significant association with treatment variables
Results are robust to different handling of missing data (pending sensitivity analyses)

5. Consider Multiple Imputation
Given the systematic pattern, consider imputation for the last question only (not full non-responders) as these cases likely represent survey fatigue rather than meaningful non-response.
Next Steps

Investigate why the last question has differential missingness
Test composite reliability with and without the last item
Run main analyses with current approach (≥4 items)
Conduct sensitivity analyses as outlined
Report any substantive differences in findings across approaches
